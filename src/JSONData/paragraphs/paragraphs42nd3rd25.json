Now, in this case, the minister, when he\nwas making his remarks and answering questions at the early stages at the\nintroduction of this bill, said that they'd consulted with labour.","index":"00504","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And I\nknow, I have actually consulted with labour, and while they are supportive of\nwhat's in this bill and think it will be not a bad thing for their members, the\none thing that really was missing was actual consultation�meaningful\nconsultation�with those very folks. ","index":"00505","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So while they actually give their support to this bill, they would\nagain urge the government to try to do things differently, to actually try to\nlive up to some of their catchphrases and buzzwords and things of that nature,\nto actually be open and transparent, to actually sit down and talk to people. ","index":"00506","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now, I know they've said they've had all these online\nconsultations, which really aren't consultations at all. But the other\ninteresting part about consultation is not just that they've heard what you\nsaid�which is hard enough with this government, to make them hear what you're\nsaying, because they have their ideological earmuffs on most of the time that\nthey can only hear, I guess, what their Premier (Mr. Pallister) says�but take\nthose off every now and again and listen to what Manitobans are saying. ","index":"00507","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The consultation piece is important in that not only do you hear\npeople, but you take into account what people have told you, what people have\nsaid, what people's concerns and interests are so that when you're drafting\nlegislation such as this, perhaps maybe in the future you don't just draft the\nbare bones necessary to say, look at us, we've got a win, we've passed a piece\nof legislation that accomplished something, when in fact you could've drafted a\npiece of legislation that accomplished so much more. ","index":"00508","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So that's really the main issue that we have with this particular\npiece of legislation, is while it does guarantee a working Manitoban the right\nto refuse to work on a Sunday, if a working Manitoban needed a Saturday as\nopposed to a Sunday�maybe for child-care reasons, maybe if there's two people\nin the household that are working and one of them gets Saturday off and one\ngets Sunday off, maybe if one of them could have refused to work on a Saturday�again,\nnot necessarily for religious reasons but just because that's the way their\nwork schedules were�then they would be able to be home to spend time with the\nchildren that are out of school. ","index":"00509","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And I certainly appreciate businesses�particu�larly small\nbusinesses, local businesses�that want to see the shopping days extended so\nthat they can be able to try and compete with online shopping that's certainly\ncut in a lot to local sales. And I appreciate that this will give some of those\nsmaller local employers the opportunity to be open seven days a week, and I\nhope that they appreciate that not all of their employees need a Sunday. ","index":"00510","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nwhile the government itself came up short, I would urge local employers to\nreally look at who your employees are, treat them with the dignity and respect\nthat they deserve that they don't get from this government and recognize that\nsome of them may want a day other than Sunday, recognize that some of them may\nwant a day other than Remembrance Day�and, certainly, I appreciate the\nimportance of Remembrance Day.

But again, there may be\nother days when workers would appreciate being able to be with their families,\nand as I said earlier in the second stage debate, maybe some folks want to be\nwith their families on Thanksgiving, but they don't have that right with this\nparticular piece of legislation. ","index":"00513","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nwithout trying to hammer it too hard, even though the government says that\nthey've decided to allow people to have this right on a Sunday and there's no\nreligious connotations attached to it, clearly there is. Their mindset is still\nthe Christian concept of Sunday being a day of rest and that we should all\nconform. Certainly, there are many different religions and there are many\npeople that have no particular religious affiliation, that have no particular\nreligious beliefs, that Sunday carries no more meaning to them than Tuesday. ","index":"00514","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I\nwould've urged the government to be a little more expansive in what they\nconsidered for a day of rest for families.
