I can read through them: All WCB board members\nare appointed by government. While government must consult with relevant\nstakeholder groups for the purpose of making board appointments, the ultimate\nauthority and discretion in appointment lies with government. The WCB may make\nregulations in many areas impacting its operations as described in section\n68(1) of the act; however, the government can disallow any regulation within 30\ndays.
