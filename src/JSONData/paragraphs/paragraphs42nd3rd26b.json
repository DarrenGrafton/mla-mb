And\nfirst I'd like to acknowledge Mayran Kalah; I mentioned her this morning. I\nfirst actually met Mayran at a comedy night. Mayran is a comedian, amongst many\nother things; she's hilarious, and I met her at a comedy night at the Good Will\nSocial Club. I couldn't believe, after watching her perform, that it was the\nsecond time ever that she'd ever performed comedy on a stage. ","index":"00641","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nwhat was so special about Mayran's performance was that she was talking from a\nplace of lived experience as a refugee, as an immigrant, as a mother, she says,\nto 7,000 kids, someone who came from the bushes of Somalia here�to here in\nWinnipeg. And we formed a friendship after that evening. I was just in awe of\nhow passionate she was for community and the work that she did selflessly on\nbehalf of her community.","index":"00642","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nMayran introduced me, down the road, to Fowsia Sheikhali, who's become a dear\nfriend and is somebody who actually brought the idea for this bill forward to\nme initially. And, you know, it's building those relationships that lead to\nmoments like this where we see bills being passed that reflect the needs of the\ncommunities here in Manitoba. ","index":"00643","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Interestingly\nenough, Manitoba will become the second jurisdiction in North America to pass a\npiece of legislation like this. The first jurisdiction is Ontario, where\nMPP�NDP MPP Faisal Hassan passed that piece of legislation. And Faisal came to\nCanada, I believe, 1990, and actually the first place that he resided was right\nhere in Winnipeg, and, you know, as a recently elected MPP in Ontario, made a\npoint of making sure that, you know, his community, as a Somali immigrant, is\ncelebrated, uplifted and acknowledged. And it was because he passed that\nlegislation in Ontario that Fowsia was inspired to bring this forward and ask\nif we could do the same thing in Union Station. ","index":"00644","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nwhat that really speaks to to me, Madam Speaker, is the importance of\nrepresentation, the foundational importance of folks seeing themselves\nreflected in their elected officials and the opportunities that are generated\nfrom that represen�tation, the confidence that's generated for people to be\nable to go to their elected officials who they see themselves in and ask them\nto put forward a bill that would amplify the voices and the beauty that is\nencompassed in their community.

Yes, it's important to celebrate Somali heritage week and Somali\nIndependence Day and to celebrate communities, but it's also important to\nacknowledge that, you know, there are many folks who live in Manitoba who are\nstill facing disproportionate, negative things that they shouldn't have to in\n2020.

And I'm really excited to be able to share that,\nyou know, for all the folks who are following Manitoba politics, who are\nlearning more and more about what's going on, all the folks that we represent\nin Union Station.
