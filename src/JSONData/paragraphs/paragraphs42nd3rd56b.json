So, school taxes include\nthe community revitalization levy. ","index":"00351","speaker":""},{"html":"����� This\nbill is designed to reduce school taxes by means of a system of rebates. So,\nbasically this amends The Property Tax and Insulation Assistance Act to provide\nfor the following rebates beginning in 2021, which is 25 per cent of school\ntaxes on farm and residential properties and 10 per cent of school taxes on\nother properties.

If a person other than the rebate recipient is responsible for the\nproperty tax, the person may recover their share of the rebate from the rebate\n'recimpiet.' The rebate may be paid before or after the school taxes are due\nand no application for this rebate is required.
