And the point to be made here is that the\ngovernment's increase of hydro alone will eat up almost all if not most of that\nfor most Manitobans. So again, this is that bait and switch that this\ngovernment loves to do that they, you know, give with one hand and take more\nfrom the other.","index":"00549","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nthen we compare that average homeowner in Winnipeg, that $385 to the Premier's\n(Mr. Pallister) own circumstance. His $2.5‑million mansion on Wellington\nCrescent, his half-a-million-dollar coun�try estate. He has commercial property\nin the city of Portage.
