But we are\nreally, really begging that this government will get on board, and we need a\nseniors' advocate here in Manitoba, someone where seniors and their families\ncan go and provide their concern in a non-partisan way so that they can get the\nhelp that they deserve.

And&nbsp;&nbsp;they were seriously\nconcerned because, yes, they're in the position they can drive their children\nto school, which not all parents are, but these are four different schools, six\ndifferent children that likely meet a minimum four different cohorts, likely\nsix different cohorts, all then coming back to one big family.","index":"00701","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So parents\nwere very nervous about encountering this, about having to make decisions.

I'm starting to feel a little more optimistic because school\ndivisions, I hear, have been working incredibly well with families and parents\nand students and trying to find adaptive ways to ensure that if parents are\nfeeling more comfortable to keep their children home, they can try and create a\nway to do so.","index":"00702","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But, Madam Speaker, we also have to keep in mind, not everyone is\nin the position to keep their children at home or send their children to\nprivate school.
