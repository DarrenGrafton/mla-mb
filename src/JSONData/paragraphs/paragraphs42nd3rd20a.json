People aren't deciding to steal metal because the penalties for doing\nso aren't big enough; people aren't deciding to steal metal because we have a\nlack of legislation that prevents them from being able to sell it; they're\nstealing it because many folks who are engaging in this are suffering from the\neffects of poverty�and, in fact, sometimes deep, deep poverty.

We have to recognize that when people are\nengaging in these behaviours and they're in these types of situations, these\nare folks who are often without identification. These are folks that are often\nwithout access to a bank account. They often lack access to housing.
