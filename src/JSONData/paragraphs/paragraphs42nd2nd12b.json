It needs to be a living document\nthat we can, in fact, build on, to in fact give the voices to the people that\nnever had the voices.","index":"00574","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Miigwech,\nMadam Speaker.","index":"00575","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(16:30)","index":"00576","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Madam Speaker:</b> Are there any further speakers on debate?","index":"00577","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Some Honourable Members:</b> Question.","index":"00578","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Madam Speaker:</b> Is the House ready for the question?
