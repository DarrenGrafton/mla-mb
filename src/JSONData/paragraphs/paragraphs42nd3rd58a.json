There's certainly a perception\nin the public that politicians are just in it for them�selves, and that they\nignore the needs of the people who actually put them into a position of power.\nWhile that perception isn't always fair, it's real and a legitimate concern of\nManitobans.","index":"00060","speaker":"Mark Wasyliw"},{"html":"����� I\nthink we have to recognize that, and we have to do what we can as elected\nofficials to preserve the integrity of our political system. It's about trust\nand having the public trust in what we do and how we conduct our business. And\nI think the way that we establish that trust is that we make sure our laws\nenhance the integrity of our political system, so that Manitobans know that\ngovernment finances are not going to be misused for purely self-promotion or\nfor partisan gains.","index":"00061","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So the\npurpose of this act is meant to ensure that the public trust is not abused,\nthat governments do not engage in cynical, partisan political actions with\ntaxpayer resources. And so this act would prohibit the name, image or title of\na Cabinet minister, including the First Minister, from being used on any\nmaterial included with a cheque mailed by the government or any government\nagency. This would prevent a gov�ern�ment, any government, from using rebate\ncheques for selfish, cynical, political self-promotion.","index":"00062","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And it would do another thing. It would also level&nbsp; the\nplaying field politically. Opposition parties obviously do not have access to\ntaxpayers' money and cannot and do not send out government cheques with the\nnames or branding on it. And there is, I think, widespread agreement from all\nparties in this House that taxpayer money should not be used for partisan,\npolitical purposes. ","index":"00063","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And we've already gone down the road a little bit with this. We have\nsome strict laws preventing governments from declaring new funding announce�ments\nclose to an election. I think over time we've learned that that was a loophole,\nthat it amounted to free 'advertwising' for the government party, that was\nbasically a political subsidy and only one that a government party could\naccess, and it disadvantaged other political parties.","index":"00064","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And the current Pallister government certainly advocated for these\npolicies, and I don't disagree with them. I think that was right that they did\nthat. ","index":"00065","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But this law that we're talking about today is basically an\nextension of that work. The same logic applies. The same policy prescription\napplies. So this would close another loophole that can be abused by a\ngovernment party�that provides, basically, an ad�vertising subsidy that isn't\nopen to other political parties. ","index":"00066","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So we know this government is not beyond using this loophole, and\nhas used this loophole in the past. And we just have to look at last year at\nthe rebate cheques that were sent out, and that was about $45&nbsp;million of\nborrowed money which was sent to seniors whether they needed it or not. And it\nwas basically a tool from the Premier (Mr. Pallister)�had his signature on\nit�and it was all about branding and self-promotion. ","index":"00067","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And ironically, this Premier and his government's popularity\ndropped after those cheques were sent out. So it didn't even have the desired\neffect that this government had wanted. They were widely criticised for what\nwas obvious to everybody at the time, that this was a partisan political move.\nAnd not only did,&nbsp; you know, the Premier lose respect from the, sort of,\nyou know, the commentariat, but also, you know, it&nbsp; also affected his\nhapless Cabinet and the entire PC&nbsp; Party. ","index":"00068","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And, you know, that's fine, they deserve it and nobody's going to\nshed a tear for them. But my concern is that there's a spillover effect because\nwhen they do this, Manitobans have a hard time distin�guishing between ethical\nand moral political parties like the Manitoba NDP and more, sort of, cronyistic\nand cynical, self-serving parties like the PCs. And so everybody gets painted\nwith the same sort of sleazy brush. ","index":"00069","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And it certainly ends up infecting the integrity of the entire\npolitical system. People mistrust politicians, even though it's really the PCs\nthat they mistrust, and they stop voting. They stop being engaged and they stop\nbeing part of the democratic process. And that hurts all of us. And it makes\nour democracy less than it ought to be. ","index":"00070","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So this kind of bill would be needed, you know, now more than ever,\nbecause we've seen that this government has a history and a track record of not\nbeing trusted with making sure the best decisions for all Manitobans and\nleaving partisan politics out of important things like taxation. ","index":"00071","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, unfortunately, this is very necessary because we know this\ngovernment is currently attempting to use the education property tax rebates\nfor Manitobans as a political self-promotion tool. Rather than getting these\ncheques out to Manitobans as fast as they can, we're now going through this\nlaboured process with Bill&nbsp;71 so that they can basically put the Premier's\nbranding and signature on these thing�on these cheques. And that this is a form\nof taxpayer-funded subsidy for political advertising for the government. ","index":"00072","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So tax\ninformation should be non-partisan. It's not appropriate for any government to\nuse taxation as an opportunity for self-promotion or the dissemination of\npolitical propaganda. And this government's Bill&nbsp;71, if passed, would\nrequire tax notices to include, in quotes, material supplied by the minister.","index":"00073","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(10:30)","index":"00074","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nbill 20�229 would remedy this. It would give this government an opportunity to\nprove that this is not, in fact, a political stunt to force the inclusion of\ngovernment propaganda with important tax infor�mation, and that they're genuine\nwhen they say they want to do this for the, you know, sincere benefit of\nManitobans and not for their own cynical, political will.","index":"00075","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I\nwould hope, given their own track record on advertising close to writ drops,\nthis is basically the same type of bill, same type of idea behind it, that they\nwould go, yes, you know what, this is fair and we're going to be in opposition\nsoon probably for another 17&nbsp; years, and we don't want you guys doing this\nto us, and so let's keep a level playing field and let's do what's right for\nManitobans, set aside partisan, you know, sort of gamesmanship and just make\nsome good policy.
