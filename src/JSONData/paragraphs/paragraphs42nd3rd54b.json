Well, I think the No. 1 reason, Mr. Deputy Speaker, is because\nthis province and the people of this province have seen that this government,\nthis Premier, these Cabinet ministers, this whole caucus, cannot be trusted to\nlead.

But the risks of\nmortality that seniors in Manitoba were going to face, did we take any special\nmeasures to make sure that our seniors in our long-term-care facilities, our\npersonal-care homes, were protected?
