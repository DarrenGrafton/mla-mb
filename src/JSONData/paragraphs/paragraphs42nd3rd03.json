The original cut was promised to be $850&nbsp;million a\nyear. That's $850&nbsp;million a year out of the education budget every year,\nMadam Speaker, $8.5&nbsp;billion over 10&nbsp;years, and there was a promise it\nwouldn't happen until the budget was balanced.

People who own property, generally, are people who\nare better off than people who don't own property. And the more property you\nhave, the more you pay in taxes. So right now, the PC government is proposing\nto borrow money, at interest, to give people who are generally better off a tax\ncut. There will be less money for education.

People who pay income tax. People who pay PST.\nPeople who pay business taxes. If you ran a business, would you take out a loan\nso your big-spending clients would spend less at your store? Your debt goes up,\nand your revenue goes down. If the PCs were running a business, they would be\ngoing into debt to pay people to shop less at their store.
