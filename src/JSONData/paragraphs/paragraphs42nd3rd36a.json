","index":"00009","speaker":""},{"html":"����� An\nopportunity for what, you might ask. Well, it's an opportunity to put the\ninterests of union members ahead of the interests of union leaders. ","index":"00010","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nNDP have clearly stated, by their words and actions, that they are beholden to\nunion leaders.

It's about accountability for union members\nand for all Manitobans. ","index":"00017","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Let me\nbriefly get into the technical aspects of this bill. I feel it is both necessary\nand important.","index":"00018","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now,\nthe current lobbyist�or legislation says that union representatives who attempt\nto influence gov�ern��ment are lobbying. That includes speaking with government\nMLAs, with Cabinet ministers, but it also includes speaking with opposition\nMLAs or even a member of any of those officials' staff.","index":"00019","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now,\ncurrently, there are these two narrow exemptions that allow unions to go about\ntheir work of actively negotiating with government as part of collective\nbargaining or to represent an individual union member's interest. Those\nactivities of union members�or union representatives, rather, and those alone,\nare currently not considered lobbying under the act.","index":"00020","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I have\nto emphasize the word narrow. These exemptions, as spelled out, cannot and do\nnot exclude all activities of union representatives. In fact, union members\nthat I spoke with expected that their union leadership would be engaged in\nattempting to influence the government on their behalf, not just at the\ncollective bargaining table, but everywhere.","index":"00021","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, by\ndefinition, and by expectation, you would expect to see a lot of union\nrepresentatives listed in the Lobbyists Registry, but we don't. There are\nthousands of entries in the Lobbyists Registry, but to find union\nrepresentatives, you have to search far and high�or low�far and low. You have\nto <i>[inaudible]</i> There are�they are few and far between on that list.","index":"00022","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now, I\nmust make one notable exception. My survey of the thousands of lobbyists\nentries in the registry over the past decade showed that one union did, in\nfact, appear to take seriously their obligation before the law to register as\nlobbyists, and that's the Manitoba Teachers' Society.� ","index":"00023","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In a\nquick search, I found that Norm Gould, James Bedford, Samantha Turenne and even\nLiam Martin had registered as lobbyists. So, thank you to them for their work\nand for taking their responsibilities under this act seriously. ","index":"00024","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nthen why don't we see many other entries from union leaders in the lobbyists\nregistrar? Well, I can think of four possible reasons. I'm happy to hear more&nbsp;\nfrom the members opposite or even my own colleagues.","index":"00025","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But\nthe four that I can think of is, first, union leadership are not aware of their\nobligation under the act. I hope that today's debate alone, whether this bill\nis passed or not, will help resolve this issue. ","index":"00026","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Second,\nunion leadership are aware of the rules but somehow believe that those rules\ndon't apply to them or their activities. Perhaps they broadly define collective\nbargaining as everything that they do. I think I've heard the member from Flin\nFlon say that.

I can scarcely believe\nthat they think, you know, who�leading�or, sorry, deciding who would lead the\nNDP is a form of collective bargaining. I sure hope not, but in any case, I\nthink today's bill will remove that confusion by removing that narrow\nexemption. ","index":"00029","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now, the third possibility is that union leadership are aware of\nthe rules and they believe that they apply to them, but they just don't care. I\ncertainly hope that that is not the case, because if it is, then there needs to\nbe consequences. And I would expect that the members opposite would join with\nme today in clearly communicating that unions are not above the law, and that\nthey are required to register as lobbyists when they are engaged in that type\nof behaviour. ","index":"00030","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now, the fourth possibility�and this is the possibility that was of\nmost interest to union members that I spoke to�was that union leadership are in\nfact not actively engaged in attempting to influence government. ","index":"00031","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Why are union members interested in that possibility? Well, they\nwonder what their union leaders are accomplishing. They wonder where all their\nunion dues that they're paying, paycheque after paycheque, are getting spent.\nThey wonder if union leaders are willing to be transparent and accountable\nabout their activities and their use of union dues.","index":"00032","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now, I believe that governments, unions and indeed every leader\nneeds to be willing to be trans�parent and accountable to their membership, to\nthose who support them financially, whether through taxes, union dues or\nmembership fees. And this bill represents a small opportunity to increase that\ntransparency, increase the accountability. ","index":"00033","speaker":""},{"html":"����� It's a small opportunity for the NDP to finally realize they don't\nhave to submit to the narrow interests of a few union leaders, but they can put\nthe interests of all Manitobans and union members ahead of those own interests.\n","index":"00034","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Madam Speaker, spring is in the air. Change is happening, but the\nquestion I'm asking myself is, is the NDP prepared to change or not? Are they\ngoing to continue to do what they've always done? Are they going to continue to\nneglect the interests of union members, the interests of all Manitobans? Are\nthey going to continue to think that they ought to be the ones being served,\nrather than doing the serving?","index":"00035","speaker":""},{"html":"����� That's, I think, the question that the members opposite have to ask\nthemselves. And I certainly hope that they'll come up with a�with the right\nresponse and the right answer because, in the interests of all Manitobans, all\nof us MLAs, no matter what our political affiliation�whether we're\nindependents, Liberals, NDP or Progressive Conservatives�we all have to\nrecognize that our own interests are not the ones that we should be concerned about.","index":"00036","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We should be concerned about the interests of all Manitobans, and\nthis bill represents an opportunity to do that. It represents an opportunity to\nprovide transparency and clarity into what union leaders are busy doing, how\nthey are attempting to influence government, what the topics of conversation\nare, to make them accountable to their own membership.","index":"00037","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I'm a big fan of increasing accountability. I'm a big fan of\nincreasing transparency. That applies not&nbsp; just to our government, where\nwe're clearly demonstrating that commitment, but to union leader�ship as well,\nand I would say to the leadership of every political party. All of those people\nin those positions need to demonstrate transparency and accountability.","index":"00038","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, Madam Speaker, I know change is hard, and the NDP may not have\nyet hit rock bottom. They might not have clued in that they can't treat\ntaxpayers and union members with disrespect. They can't squeeze dollar after\ndollar of them without being accountable for it.
