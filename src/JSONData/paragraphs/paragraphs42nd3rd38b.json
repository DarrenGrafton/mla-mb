And they actually even have a\ngoal in mind of how much they want to sell out Manitoba. And that's refreshing\nbecause in almost every other aspect of government they are attempting to do\nthe same thing and gaslighting Manitobans at oh, no, no, we're not trying to\nprivatize, but of course they are. ","index":"00558","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And certainly, when I met with the\nminister and we had a bill briefing, he said that's exactly what they're trying\nto do. They want to sell land more quick�ly. This is the sell-land-more-quickly\nact. And what is the impediment here that they need to remove to, you know,\nsell out Manitoba? Well, what's in place of course is safeguards, protections,\nthings to prevent Manitobans from being harmed by these sales. What is being\nremoved are accountability measures. ","index":"00559","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And sort of the main one here, big\nchange, is they're lowering the level of government scrutiny in the sale of\npublic lands. So the Minister of Finance (Mr. Fielding) now, on his own�and we\ncertainly have witnessed his level of discretion�can now sell land between\n$200,000 and $1 million without any Cabinet approval.

Well, that means 93 per cent of land transactions between the Province\nof Manitoba will now fall under his exclu�sive scrutiny without having Cabinet\nlook over his shoulder and make sure that it's okay. So we're relying on the\njudgment of one individual as opposed to an entire Cabinet, which, you know, I\nappreciate it's a Conservative government. So it's not particularly diverse or\nrepresentative of Manitoba, but ideally, say, a New Democratic Cabinet would\nbe. And so you would have many voices around the table with many different\nperspectives making sure that this trans�action's actually in the public\ninterest, and it's not just meant to pad the pockets of well-heeled\nConservative insiders. And so that's obviously of concern, that that level of\nscrutiny is not going to be there. And that level of oversight is not going to\nbe there. ","index":"00561","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The second really concerning\naspect of this bill is that there is an element of stealth involved because\nthere are regulations that are going to come later. And these regulations, they\nwill be allowed to increase the Finance Minister's discretion even though this\nbill is currently going to affect 93 per cent of the current sales. There is\nnothing preventing them in regulations that the minister could have easy access\nto 100&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of sales. And, of course, Manitobans will not be\nprotected from such a scheme.

","index":"00583","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We do feel that it's really important to have�if you're going to\nsell Crown land�a really good process for valuation of that land, a fair\nvaluation, that we don't have giveaways of land, that we have fair valua�tion\nof that land before decisions are made. This is important and, quite frankly,\nthis presumably would be in regulation, but we'd like to have better assurance\non that.

","index":"00608","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Justice\nofficials in Manitoba have been resolute in addressing challenges. In 2008, as\nI said, that review was undertaken of the Manitoba Human Rights Commission and\nof the Manitoba Human Rights Adjudication Panel. The purpose was to address\nthese delays.

","index":"00611","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In\nparticular, this bill brings The Human Rights Code into alignment with other\njurisdictions in Canada. This is always an important consideration for debate\nin this Chamber. I'm often asked in the question-and-answer period that follows\nthe minister's remarks whether there are jurisdictional comparisons, and I\nwould want to satisfy that concern for all members and say this was part of the\nanalysis taken by Mr. Fineblit to look at other jurisdictions, to see what was\nbeing done in those jurisdictions to improve access to justice in respect of\ntheir human rights commissions and those processes. ","index":"00612","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nso, in Manitoba we are looking for that same&nbsp;&nbsp;change now to provide\nthe Human Rights Commission with the authority to decline to investi�gate\ncomplaints that are frivolous, without merit or fall outside of the statutory\njurisdiction. ","index":"00613","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I\nwould say for the purpose of debate that, yes, there are those times, and it\nhas been after experience with the Human Rights Commission that it would be\nadvantageous to have the commission executive dir�ector be able to make that\nlitmus test, that threshold determination of a complaint to say, does this meet\nthe test? ","index":"00614","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nthere can be many issues that go into discussing whether that does or does not\nmeet the test of a threshold requirement for a complaint that should be\ninvestigated and then could proceed as a complaint by a complainant for the\nadjudicator to hear. ","index":"00615","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\ncurrently, what happens is the commission is required to investigate every\nsingle complaint and that is not otherwise resolved through alternative dispute\nresolution. So enabling the commission to decline to investigate complaints\nthat are clearly without merit, or are better addressed through other avenues,\nwould improve the efficiency of the complaint system. ","index":"00616","speaker":""},{"html":"It would allow the commission to dedicate its resources, then, to\ncomplaints that require that thorough investigation and resolution. And I will\nspeak for just a little while this afternoon about what would be those\ncategories in which the executive director could make that determination.","index":"00617","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But\nthese amendments to go on will also stream�line decision making by moving\ndecision-making authority from the commission's board to the execu�tive\ndirector, in accordance with the procedures employed by other human rights\ncommissions in Canada and other administrative decision makers. A shift will\nhelp parties receive decisions more quickly by eliminating unnecessary\noperational processes. ","index":"00618","speaker":""},{"html":"����� It is\nsimply the determination, the recommenda�tions of Mr. Fineblit in his report\nthat we were relying too much on the board, which may convene every four weeks\nor eight weeks or 10 weeks, but essentially we had this executive director in\nplace at all times, who could advance things, and then notify the board in a\nproper governance way of decisions that are under�taken. So this shifts some\nresponsibilities now that are the responsibility of the board of directors to\nthe executive director. And, as I said, consistent with other jurisdictions in\nCanada. ","index":"00619","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nbill also helps to address issues of timeliness and fairness of human rights\nhearings by allowing the Human Rights Adjudication Panel to develop clear\nhearing procedures and introduce time limits for the commencement of hearings\nand the issuance of decisions. These are accountability measurements. They are\nguidance systems that would allow them to&nbsp;&nbsp;say a minimum�a maximum\nnumber of days, for&nbsp;&nbsp;instance, before a complaint must proceed. A max�imum\nnumber of days before a decision that's been reached is communicated. And those\nthings we know throughout organizations can be helpful to clarify, so this bill\nseeks to clarify those things as well. ","index":"00620","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nbill also seeks to support parties in using restorative approaches. And this is\nimportant because we are�we need to constantly be mindful of the ability of\nalternative ways to resolve disputes; not everything is best heard by an\nadjudicator at the Human Rights Commission. This is also the finding of Mr.\nAllan Fineblit. So we want to encourage the resolving of some human rights\ncomplaints through alternative means�restorative approaches, and reducing the\nnum�ber of complaints that proceed to a full hearing as a result. ","index":"00621","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now,\nmembers of the opposition might say, well, there are some cases that are very,\nvery serious and you're talking about a process that, you know, provides an\noff-ramp. I would suggest in response that it's precisely the function, then,\nof the Human Rights Commission executive director to make that de�termination.\nAnd, in serious cases, those are exactly the complaints that need to proceed\nmore expediently to the process. But we do know from experience, many\nsituations, many complaints have been able to be favourably disposed of in a\nmanner that made sense and in a manner that met the satisfaction of all\nparties, and that helps in the overall carriage of justice. So this bill\nprovides adjudicators with that authority to mediate complaints at the hearing\nstage. ","index":"00622","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Together,\nwe believe that these instruments will ensure inefficiencies that are currently\nin the legislation will be remediated, they would reflect this government's\ncommitment to reduce unnecessary re�gula�tory requirements, it would streamline\ngovern�ment operations. Manitobans have the right to expect timely and fair\nhuman rights decisions as a result of these important legislative enhancements.\n","index":"00623","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And,\nfinally, I should also indicate that the bill does increase certainty for all\nparties by capping the amount of damages for injury, to dignity, feelings and\nself respect. In other jurisdiction, including the Saskatchewan Human Rights\nCommission and in their legislation, and also, in the Canadian Human Rights\nCommission, we have the same type of cap, and this bill would seek to set that\ncap at $25,000, which we believe is appropriate. ","index":"00624","speaker":""},{"html":"����� However,\nat the same point in time, there is no cap, of course, on other awards that an\nadjudicator can make when it comes to compensation for things like financial\nlosses; there would be no rationale to cap financial losses. Losses could have\nbeen $75,000, they could have been $100,000, and there would no argument to\nsupport the capping of those amounts. So this is the clarification that I\nwanted to give. There's also other categories like exemplary damages that have\ncaps currently, and this legislation does not propose changes to that.
