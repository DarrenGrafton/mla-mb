Because again, if you were\nto actually talk to people who have to go to work through the pandemic, who\nhave to be on the front lines, people who fall into that essential-worker\ncategory, the things that they're asking for are starkly different from what\nthe govern�ment backbench is trying to legislate with this bill before us\ntoday.","index":"00013","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The priorities the working people\nhave outlined during the pandemic are things like paid sick leave, being able\nto stay home when you're sick so that you can do your part to slow down on\ncommunity spread.

Again, to me, it makes no sense, certainly not from a progressive\nperspective, but I would argue from a conservative perspective also, why should\nanyone who works full time have to live in poverty? Doesn't make any sense to\nme. Again, even if you're a conservative, it seems like the whole idea behind,\nyou know, economic motivation and economic incentive is to provide people some\nsort of, like, stimulus so that they take part in the workforce.

And so,\nin the spirit of this resolution, I call on the member to push her government\nto make sure that our local organizations have access to the resources they\nneed in order to continue to do this good work and, in fact, enhance and expand\non the good work that they do. ","index":"00296","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I know from personal experience, as somebody who is a very mediocre\ngardener, how beneficial it is to have people in your communities who have that\nexpertise and are very generous in sharing it. I had an unfortunate experience\na few years ago�a couple of years ago, with a neighbourhood cat, a few of them\nI&nbsp; believe�might be a wild allegation to make in this House but I'm\nputting it on the record�that was consistently and insistently using my garden\nbeds as a personal washroom, which made it very difficult for me to be\nmotivated to get in the dirt and get those things growing. But you know what? I\nreached out to some local neighbourhood organizations. I really did, because\nthey had these great programs.

And so, you know, it would've been\ngreat to, alongside with this resolution, see some efforts being made here or\nsome dialogue around what this government intends to do make sure that we have\nsafe and healthy communities and an environment to do this work in.

And these\nfolks are living&nbsp; in&nbsp; neighbourhoods that have been affected by lead&nbsp;\ncontamination. These are folks who may want to&nbsp; establish backyard and\ncommunity gardens, but un��fortu�nately face risks in doing so.
