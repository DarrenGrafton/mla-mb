In fact, tuitions\nthis year have increased twice, which is rather unusual. So, how is increasing\ntuition fees compatible with accessibility? That is the first question I would\nlike to ask this committee. How does increasing tuition fees, or eliminating\nmeasures designed to limit the increase of tuition fees, foster accessibility\nto post-secondary education?

The proposals of the\namendment of the advanced education and�sorry�The Advanced Education\nAdministration Act that are included in Bill&nbsp;33 have been justified as a\nmeans to, in quote: enable the minister to issue guidelines concerning tuition\nfees and student fees charged by universities.

Something that I\nknow many science students use is the sample exam booklets that the library\nhas, as well as tutoring materials and textbooks; they are extremely valuable,\nnot to mention that some students are unable to afford textbooks to begin with,\nbut by paying these lesser fees to the libraries, they're able to access and\nborrow textbooks as study materials from the library at a much more affordable\ncost.","index":"00414","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We are\nactively working towards the increase of open educational resources, and\nlibraries will become increasingly valuable and play a key role in this new\nresource for students.

These lab fees are remarkably low considering the high-end equipment\nand resources that are made available to us in a lab setting. I have seen what\na science course without�with less of a lab component looks like this year\nthrough the online environment, and I strongly believe the tactile learning\nenvironment accompanied by the extremely expensive equipment we normally have\naccess to, plays an immense role in the quality of learning that we receive.

","index":"00477","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I\nwould like to begin my address by fully acknowledging that on April 9th, we\nexperienced an incredibly important day in the province of Manitoba for student\nadvocacy and government relations. Minister Ewasko has committed in an official\ncapacity&nbsp;&nbsp;through a Manitoba government news release to bring forward\nan amendment to better protect student organizations from having their fees\nmade non-compulsory or otherwise reduced as part of the bill's future use.

And\nwhile the amendment is welcomed and necessary and celebrated, the bill would\nstill be able to regulate certain student services fees charged by our institutions\nas opposed to charged by student unions, who would be protected under the\namendment. ","index":"00481","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nthat is a situation which does continue to leave many students feeling uneasy,\nand I think that we've heard those comments from Savannah, from Brendan and\nfrom a couple of others who've spoken before me. ","index":"00482","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But\nyou might be wondering, you know, why is that? Isn't a government\nshoulder-check a good thing?

","index":"00483","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And by\nand large, he correctly outlines a couple student frustrations with fees. But\nwhat I would say is it needs to be a shoulder-check with a healthy dose of\nconsultation, and I believe, Minister Ewasko, you've committed to that practice\nafter multiple addresses tonight but, sort of, to make the point more salient,\nI will proceed in highlighting the concerns of students I've heard as we've\ncontinued to develop our strategy around Bill 33 and have understood some of\nthose unintended consequences. ","index":"00484","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(20:00)","index":"00485","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nlook: savings are great; they're needed now more than ever, but not at the cost\nof measures that facilitate student success, retention and completion�which I\nknow this government values incredibly highly�and I value it incredibly highly\nfor that matter. And, if these sort of savings are created but there are\nunintended consequences, we may inadvertently create difficulties for students\nthrough a poorly applied Bill&nbsp;33. ","index":"00486","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nknow, Minister Ewasko, you've noted that Bill&nbsp;33 would seek to protect\nstudents from overly large increases and ensure that education remains\naccessible and affordable, and I do sincerely hope that is how the bill is\ngoing to be used. But in order for that to happen, we would like to point out\nthat the minister needs to have plentiful consultation and consistent dialogue\nwith our administrations to fully understand the impacts, sort of, of each\norder to decrease a particular fee. ","index":"00487","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And I\nreally appreciate the opportunity, maybe, to illustrate a little more clearly\nwhat it is that I mean. So, let's maybe take the library fee as one example. I\nbelieve the minister has named this as one fee that would fall under the\nlegislation, would require further examination, so I'm sort of just picking on\nit for that reason. And it may look like a fee that would be attractive to\nreduce or otherwise make non-compulsory. So, what might that mean? ","index":"00488","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Well,\nthe library fee is used in part to improve access to open-source material for\nstudents, parti�cularly open educational resources. So, sort of the more\nopen-source material available to students. Fewer and fewer students need to\npurchase textbooks for, you know, $300 at piece. And that provides universal\nand instant savings to thousands of students. But without a library fee�or with\nsignificantly reduced library fee���the university couldn't necessarily\ncontinue to pursue this project in a manner that is needed to create meaningful\nsavings for students. ","index":"00489","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nsort of another ancillary sort of consequence of this is that the university\nmay need to implement new processes to monitor that only those paying the full\nfee are accessing library spaces and services, in an event that the fee is\nmade, like, entirely non-com�pulsory. ","index":"00490","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But,\nimportantly, these sort of impacts are not&nbsp;&nbsp;only isolated to\nsomething like a library fee. This year, the Student Accessibility Services\ncentre added two additional co-ordinators to assist students with disabilities,\nand without an adequate student services fee, I'm not certain that would be\npossible. ","index":"00491","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nwhat we see is that we also limit our ability to improve existing services when\nthe impacts of Bill&nbsp;33 are not fully explored before implementation. ","index":"00492","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, I\nthink it's clear, when using correctly and at the sole discretion of the\nminister, though the�sort of, the intentions are really well-placed, we sort of\nsee two risks that arise, and the first is that cuts to fees that&nbsp;&nbsp;are\nused to implement services which foster student success may lead those services\nto disappear altogether or remain stagnant in their operations, not improving\nservice quality, remaining sub-par. Or, sort of, the second risk we see is\nincreased internal inefficiency or administrative burdens placed on our\nuniversity if they seek to monitor these imple�mentations. ","index":"00493","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nthe takeaway is really that good intentions can have unintended consequences. I\nurge the 'miniter's' team to consult thoroughly with the university before\nmaking determinations on which fees would be compulsory, non-compulsory or\notherwise reduced. ","index":"00494","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And I\nthink�I'll sort of end my address today by noting that a wise man once said\nthat the most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the\ngovernment and I'm here to help. So Minister Ewasko, please do consult our\ninstitutions, listen to senior leadership and faculty voice.","index":"00495","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We at\nMAPSS currently operate in incredibly high regard for your office and we are\nthankful for the amendment that will be brought forward, and we ask that you\ndemonstrate a certain degree of good faith in how this legislation is applied\nmoving forward to ensure that these good intentions materialize in the way that\nsomeone like Adam might have concep�tualized and that we don't see those\nnegative, unintended consequences.","index":"00496","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Thank\nyou very much for the time, and I'm open to any questions.

","index":"00524","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nfirstly, the UWSA strongly opposes the bill's current wording that gives the\ngovernment new and absolute power over control of tuition and student fees.\nThis bill opens the door to increased tuition and other fees without\nparticipation or consent from students.

This leaves me to your amendment, and a question\nis�right now is: why haven't we not seen this�anything from this amendment yet?\nWhy leave students feeling added stress and anxiety over their futures and\neducation, especially during a pandemic right now that has already caused\nstress, anxiety and more uncertainty about moving forward with our futures?

That's\nwhat we feel is what is, again, is very wrong of this bill is there hasn't been\nthat consultation; we should've been consulted with as students right from the\nstart when this bill was first introduced or even when it was in the thought\nprocess; we should've been part of that process right from the start.

I am the father of a 21-year-old and a 17-year-old, so I am\nvery deeply concerned with universities and colleges in Manitoba for that\nreason. ","index":"01004","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I have\nalso been teaching at the University of Winnipeg in the department of political\nscience as a professor since 2000, and since 2019 I have been the chair of the\nphilosophy department. ","index":"01005","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, it\nis from, you know, that background that I&nbsp;&nbsp;was quite concerned when I\nfirst saw Bill 33. I was&nbsp;&nbsp;very pleased to see that the students have\ncommunicated with the minister and that there will be an amendment. I�you know,\nit is�it's almost 10:30 and so far all but one of the speakers tonight has been\nin opposition to this bill and see huge problems there. So I think that this\nproposed amendment is clearly not enough to make it a suitable bill.","index":"01006","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(22:30)","index":"01007","speaker":""},{"html":"����� There's\nbeen lots of discussion and lots of excellent points, and I would really like\nto thank all of the presenters beforehand and the committee members. I know\nit's getting late. I would also like to point out how fabulous the students\nthat we produce, with the evidence from tonight, because there are some\nexcellent students out there. ","index":"01008","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Many\nof the things that I want to focus on have been said, so I do want to just\npoint out that the language of the bill is quite clear; 2.2(1), the minister\nmay issue guidelines in respect of a tuition fee or student fee set by a\nuniversity board. So even though the minister will say he's just trying to\nprovide a shoulder check and wants to keep tuition low, as other people have\npointed out, that says nothing about keeping tuition low. It actually replaces\nthe previous cap that this government had raised, right, so that there was a\ncap, there's no longer a cap at 5 per cent plus inflation. As we know and have\nheard, the effects of tuition going up and up and up, and that does not help\naccessibility or any of the purported goals that this government is saying that\nthey have. ","index":"01009","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nyou know, the next two points in the bill do talk about if the tuition raises\nthat the board of governors or board of regents, in the case at the University\nof Winnipeg, agree upon�if they exceed them, then�and it sort of does talk\nabout excess so there is that in the bill. But the key part of the bill is, as\npeople have pointed out, is it is not a cap. ","index":"01010","speaker":""},{"html":"If�it seems like it's obvious that if the government wanted to succeed\nin the goals that it sets out in terms of accessibility, keeping tuition rates\nlow, that they could easily rewrite the bill. So, if you're amending the bill,\nmaybe�I mean, I think you should scrap it, everybody seems to be opposed to\nit�but at very least, do a deeper amendment to the bill and make it very clear\nin section 2.2(1) that it's not that the minister is issuing guidelines but\nthat the minister is concerned about those tuition fees going too high. ","index":"01011","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But I\nalso wanted to talk a bit about the other part of it. So, the minister has said\nthat he met with students and that there were some misunderstandings and so\nthere'll be this amendment and the language that we've been told about that is\nthat the fees set by democratic processes are exempt. ","index":"01012","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So�and,\nobviously, everybody else then tonight has been very concerned about the ones\nthat aren't exempt. And who are they set by? Well, they're set by the board of\ngovernors and the board of regents, in the case of the University of Winnipeg,\na good chunk of which, in the case of Brandon�University of Brandon and\nUniversity of Manitoba, reach almost 50 per cent of the board. ","index":"01013","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nthis is the board that the minister feels he needs to be able to override. And\nwe've heard a lot tonight about, well, language of consultation, conver�sations,\nshoulder checking�I'm not sure what the metaphor's going on there, who's\nchecking who. I think we need�maybe that's my fundamental question, what\nmetaphors are you using?","index":"01014","speaker":""},{"html":"But more than that, the words consultation and conversations don't\nappear in the bill and I think the&nbsp;&nbsp;minister knows full well that he\ncan have conversations all the time. The government sets, you know, the\nfundamental funding allotment for universities; I hope conversations are\nhappening all the time. ","index":"01015","speaker":""},{"html":"He doesn't need Bill 33 to have a conversation. He doesn't need Bill 33\nfor his�I hope not�for his government to interact with university adminis�trations\nand, before their budgets, and decide upon the budget final. So I'm not so sure\nhow this bill is doing what he's saying it's supposed to be doing.","index":"01016","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So those\nare my big questions. I do�I wonder�what this government is saying the board of\nregents and the board of governors of the universities in this province with\nthis clause that basically allows the minister to override them and it's a\npretty�I mean, you know, even the mechanics of the bill are not the sense of\nconversation. ","index":"01017","speaker":""},{"html":"If the universities don't do what the�don't follow these guidelines,\nthen the minister is to inform the Finance minister that the funds will be\ndeducted from the universities. So that does not sound very consultative. ","index":"01018","speaker":""},{"html":"You know, so those are the things that, in the detail of the bill, make\nme worry exactly like the, you&nbsp;&nbsp;know, over 20 other presenters who've\nbeen here&nbsp;&nbsp;tonight, who worry about the autonomy of universities, see\nautonomy as a central part of a university. Universities are not there at the\nwhim of the government of the day. ","index":"01019","speaker":""},{"html":"����� When I\nthink about my 17-year-old thinking about universities, he's already a bit\nfrustrated about, you know, things changing all the time and how does he plan\nout his life. Well, this bill, you know, is set up for those types of changes. ","index":"01020","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Of\ncourse, universities need to be preparing students for a changing workforce, a\nchanging world. We see that so often, but as has been said, who is best\nsituated to decide what their interested in and what they will succeed\nat�certainly not the government. ","index":"01021","speaker":""},{"html":"����� It\nseems very odd for a government that calls itself a Progressive Conservative\ngovernment to keep on putting these policies out which are big government\npolicies. It's micro-managing. ","index":"01022","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And, I\nmean, it's not related but sort of related. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;the context. As the\nchair of the philosophy department, in the middle of the summer when I was\nsupposed to be spending all my time�and it took a lot of time�to prepare for the\nonline learning�we actually had lots of summer courses that had moved very\nquickly online, lots was going on, I was working twice&nbsp;&nbsp;as hard as\nnormal not getting any research done, and&nbsp;what does this government do?\nBut tells us that we have to prepare budgets with 30 per cent cuts, 20 per cent\ncuts and 10 per cent cuts.","index":"01023","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nhere I am spending hours and hours pre�senting�preparing three different types\nof budgets in the middle of a pandemic, when I have spring courses with\nwait-lists, much actually like this year; I have tons of courses that are�the\nwait-lists are longer than can actually fit in the classes. So students are\nneeding and very eager to have courses, and we're having these cuts of�luckily\nnone of those cuts came across, and it was only a three per cent cut, and then\nsome of it was given back. This does not seem like a very efficient�this seems\nto me like the epitome of micro-managing and it doesn't work. It doesn't work\nfor intellectual reasons and the high principles that we've heard from&nbsp;&nbsp;the\nprevious speakers in terms of university autonomy, it also doesn't work at a\npractical level.

You mentioned tuition and you\nmentioned regulations and that�I mean, tuition has been regulated here in the\nprovince since the early 2000s. So with Bill 33, and I know you don't really\nlike my metaphor as far as shoulder check, but really it's the Auditor General\nsaying that, you know, government, you know, post-secondary institutions are\nbeing funded by taxpayers' dollars, and we need to just have a little bit of\noversight.","index":"01030","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(22:40)","index":"01031","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so\nI think Bill&nbsp;33 brings a really good balance to that.

","index":"01052","speaker":""},{"html":"����� However,\nwhen I look at the legislation and I compare it with the rhetoric I'm hearing,\npersonally, I hear a disjunction and I read a disjunction between what's being\nsaid and the words of�that are written within the proposed amendments. So,\nrather than placing legislative limits on tuition increases or proposing a\ncomplete�a clear statement on propor�tionality�that is what percentage of the\ncost of post-secondary education might be borne via tuition by students�even if\nthat were zero, there's an emphasis here on ministerial discretion and, as I've\nlearned this evening listening to the presentations, potentially some notion of\nveto power on proposals brought forward by institutions. ","index":"01053","speaker":""},{"html":"����� What I\nwould respectfully suggest, though, is that there is a very real potential in\nthis proposal to expose universities to unwelcome distortions. And here I'm\nspeaking of what necessarily is part of the human enterprise together, that is\nour�the challenges that we have collectively of it ending and the unintended\nconsequences of lines of behaviour that we undertake. And I want to speak\nbriefly�and I'm mindful of the time of the evening�to three of these potential\ndistortions and unintended ones.","index":"01054","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nfirst of these, for me, is distortions arising from strategic differentiation.\nAnd universities are century-old institutions and we do many things well. And\none of the things we do well is we develop new knowledge, but rather\nimportantly, we also preserve knowledge that falls in and out of fad and\nfashion. Universities, we're in it for the long game. We're in&nbsp;&nbsp;it&nbsp;&nbsp;for\nknowledge and for our students. And governments, well, by their very nature,\nthey're very different kinds of entities. ","index":"01055","speaker":""},{"html":"So governments were investing in homing pigeons when universities were\ninventing in wireless communication. And it's very dangerous in terms of the\ndevelopment of key knowledge sectors to have governments picking winter�winners\nwhen we know that there's an uncertainty in all of this. And so I'm concerned\nabout the possibility within this legislation of governmental interference in\nthe fundamental core activities of universities. ","index":"01056","speaker":""},{"html":"����� There\nare also distortions arising from the unintended consequences of action. And\nhere I'm concerned about the impact, system-wide, of the possibility of\ndifferential tuition at the program level. This, for example, places\nprofessional programs at an&nbsp;&nbsp;uneven footing. Do professional-program\ntuitions, as we've seen recently in Alberta, increase by 40&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent?\nOr do they double in light of market demand relative to the perceived personal\nvalue with credential? Is tuition used as a policy measure de�funding students\nseeking programs of study that are out of favour with whoever the government of\nthe day is? ","index":"01057","speaker":""},{"html":"We're uncertain as to how these will play themselves out, but one thing\nI'm sure of is that if we&nbsp;&nbsp;see this rolling out, they will have\nsystem-wide impacts, as students move relative to government policy as it's\napplied to differential tuition. And we've seen this in other provinces and\nit's actually placed the survivability of some institutions at risk, as\ngovernment policy influences program viability and institutions respond to\nthose changes.","index":"01058","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(22:50)","index":"01059","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Lastly,\nI talk�well, I'd like to speak to distortions arising from suppressed\ninnovation. One of the potentialities in the legislation attends to�or the\namendment, rather�attends to fee structures utilized by universities. And while\nI may be incorrect, it&nbsp;&nbsp;appears that there's an intent here to\nrestrict universities' ability to address shortfalls arising from government\nfunding by using fees.","index":"01060","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And,\nof course, this problem dissipates if uni�versities are adequately funded. But\nI wish to stress that these barriers themselves are also a barrier to\ninnovation. ","index":"01061","speaker":""},{"html":"Because if you look at the Canadian post-secondary context, universities\nhave used targeted fees to enhance international student experiences, to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;launch\nmajor technological innovations that support&nbsp;student learning,\nfacilities�expanded library resources, expanded student services and\naccessibility initiatives. ","index":"01062","speaker":""},{"html":"And by undermining the autonomy of universities and their ability to be\ninnovative in ways that may be very much welcome by students is an unwelcome\nconstraint, from my perspective.","index":"01063","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So the\nissues before the committee aren't new.

Main goal is to make sure that we're�making\nsure that our education is of top quality, sustainable and affordable. And\nthat's where Bill 33 is actually going to bring that balance.

I would say that the\n20&nbsp;per cent tuition increases since 2016 doesn't match that commitment,\nand I would urge this government to rethink, you know, the policies that have\nallowed that to take place if you truly are committed to affordable education\nin Manitoba.

","index":"01301","speaker":"Jamie Moses"},{"html":"����� I did\nwant to just address a couple of things that the minister said, you know, about\nwhether this bill brings proper balance. I mean, I don't think I heard any�an\nissue from any student about whether there was an issue with balance before\nBill 33 was brought in. Students weren't saying, we need our education\nseem�education system to be more balanced. So, I don't think that really is a\nproblem that was�that needed to be addressed, and it certainly isn't really\ntruly addressed in Bill 33. ","index":"01302","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But I\nthink that the real message of�from yourself, Matt, and I think many other\nspeakers, has been the lack of consultation, that affordability needs to be an\nissue, that it's very critical for students that accessibility is an issue for\ninstitutions. ","index":"01303","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nso, I know that you have explained many of those issues in your presentation.\nAnd so I just wanted to ask from all the members that you represent in CUPE and\nwork with�you know, what is the one thing that you would wish the minister\nwould really take away and learn and be able to actually act on and change in\nBill 33?

A lot of Manitobans have been, you know, struggling during the\npandemic�and pre-pandemic�you know, these haven't exactly been great years in\nterms of wage increases in Manitoba for those in the public sector, you know,\nwhich is very significant in Manitoba. Most have gone without any sort of raise\nfor three or four years. And if you're supporting, you know, a child or two\ngoing through university or college right now and you're seeing, you know, that\ngoing up 20 per cent over a couple years�you know, that's taking a lot of money\noff the kitchen table.

I think the issue isn't this legislation it's�that it's\nwritten as itself, it's the direction that the government is going, and I would\nurge them to move away from a direction of�which seems to be of transferring\nthe cost of education away from the provincial government and onto students and\ntheir families, and instead moving the opposite direction�find ways to make\ncollege and university more affordable for students and their families, even if\nthat means that the government of Manitoba needs to take on more of that\nburden.
