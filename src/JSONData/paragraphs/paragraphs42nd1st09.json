In 2020 there will be a transitionary rent value applied, being the\naverage that is calculated as per formula in the regulations, rental rate, and\nthe&nbsp;&nbsp;current rental rate of $2.13 for animal unit.

Under the previous agreements, the way it was set up, that\nwas available to those producers to be able to sublet it. And those days are\ngone.

There's been quite\na bit of work in other areas which suggests that there's advantages in having a\nnot completely treed area, but some more trees than just an open, flat pasture,\npartly because the cattle can get out of the sun and they can get some shade,\nand that those trees actually enhance the production that you can get off the\nland.

They've been the most conservative economic forecasters and, as was\nnoted in question period, have also been wrong the last number of years about\nManitoba. For instance, Royal Bank has a much more optimistic forecast. But\nwhat we're really looking at�we look at the private sector investments that\nwe've had in Manitoba over the last couple of years.

","index":"01501","speaker":""},{"html":"����� That is something that our government has not�we've reversed the\ncourse that the NDP was on, in terms of eroding the fisheries and the\nsustainability of the fisheries. What we have done since we've taken office is\nintroduced a voluntary quota buyback to fishers, which resulted in putting $5.5\nmillion back in the pockets of fishers�many of them whom were indigenous\nfishers�and it is also going to result in 525,000 kilograms of fish staying in\nthe lake. That is certainly on the path to ensuring sustainability of our fisheries,\nwhen we're allowing fish�more fish to stay in the lake, year over year over\nyear. ","index":"01502","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We've also looked at changing the mesh sizes and have settled on\nchanging them so that spawning walleye and sauger can at least spawn one or two\nseasons before those fish are caught in the nets. We know that under the NDP,\nthey did nothing to ensure that walleye and sauger could spawn one or two or\nthree seasons before they were caught. They did nothing to move on the mesh\nsizes, which of course resulted in many of the fish being caught at\nunsustainable levels, and so our government has enacted new policies to ensure\nthat sauger, walleye will spawn one or two seasons before they end up in the\nnets of the fishers. ","index":"01503","speaker":""},{"html":"That�s going to ultimately result in greater value for\nthe fishers, with higher yield coming out of the lake with fewer fish. And\nwe've also introduced the open market to fishers in the province of Manitoba.\nThey're getting more money. We know that the value of sauger has increased, the\nvalue of walleye has increased significantly. But what's also really of\ninterest to many is the value of the whitefish. Where this was a species that\nwas very much devalued under the NDP, we're seeing, with the introduction to\nthe open market, whitefish getting record prices for their catch. And so that�s\nputting more money in the fishers' pockets. ","index":"01504","speaker":""},{"html":"So our measures that we've done�changing the mesh\nsizes to ensure that the fish stock is sustainable, doing a voluntary quota\nbuyback to fishers, which is resulting in putting $5.5 million back in their\npockets, as well as keeping 525,000 kilograms of fish in the lake year over\nyear over year�is certainly enhancing our commercial fishery, and producing\nbetter results for our indigenous fishers throughout the province of Manitoba.","index":"01505","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I'd like to just point out the good work that the members of\nSkownan First Nation have done with their fishery.

Moving forward, we have listened,\nand the Department of Justice, of course, is no different in doing that. They\nhave made significant change. This started in 2017, when they established a\nrestorative 'justive' centre, and that's working with 49 communities. ","index":"01622","speaker":""},{"html":"����� They have also increased funding and they have added additional\nstaff to make sure that all the bases are covered. And more effective�and\nrestorative justice is recognized as a key pillar within the Criminal Justice\nSystem Modernization Strategy that exists. A goal of diverting 5,000 cases to\nrestorative justice has actually been exceeded, which is terrific. Budget 2019\nis making significant investments to key parts of that plan. ","index":"01623","speaker":""},{"html":"And just to give you an idea in dollars where this\nmoney's going to and how it is being directed to our First Nations: $400,000\nfor the MKO First Nations Justice Strategy; $270,000 for the Onashowewin\nJustice Circle; $243,000 for the Southern Chiefs' Organization Restorative\nJustice Program; $120,000 to the Hollow Water community holistic healing\ncircle; $50,000 to 'Sraint' Theresa Point First Nation justice program; $44,000\nto Fisher River Cree Nation restorative justice; and another $30,000 to\nrestorative justice in Cross Lake.

So the Justice Department in our government has been working very\nclosely with the RCMP so that they also have a better plan working towards\nrestorative justice. They are 'willerking' to build capacities within the\ncommunities and with the leadership. So again, the partnerships are\nsignificant. ","index":"01625","speaker":""},{"html":"They've gone another step further, and this is also\nbeing discussed with all federal ministers across Canada, and it's really\ninteresting that Manitoba has some really good suggestions to share with\nfederal ministers all across our country to ensure that restorative justice in\nall the communities is made easier. It�we realize that there's such significant\ncosts involved within the�for the communities and the people when they have to\ngo to other areas.
