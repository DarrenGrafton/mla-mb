I am the executive\ndirector of an enhanced non-profit nursery school here in Winnipeg that has\nbeen serving our community for the last 50 years. ","index":"00046","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I have\na number of concerns with Bill 47 and its proposed changes to our sector. This\nevening, I will be speaking to what I feel is the most concerning, and that is\nthe crisis facing our workforce. Trained, dedi�cated early childhood educators\nare the backbone of quality. They are the driving factor that determines\nwhether child-care centres are truly meeting the needs of children and\nfamilies, and our workforce is in a crisis�a crisis that would be come much\nlarger should Bill 47 pass. ","index":"00047","speaker":""},{"html":"����� When\ncompared to the rest of Canada and the child-care spaces available for children\nin their populations, Manitoba is failing. We only have licensed spaces for 19\nper cent of our children. That is a huge problem that does need to be solved,\nbut we cannot begin solving that problem until, first, we solve the problem of\nour workforce. ","index":"00048","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In\norder to create more spaces, we need 'qualifee'�qualified, trained early\nchildhood educators. That's how we're going to staff them. And I want to empha�size\nthe key factor here: qualified ECEs, meaning those who have graduated from\npost-secondary institutions with accreditation in our province. But less and\nless people are choosing the field of early learning and child care, and those\nwho are already in the sector are choosing to leave. This is a real problem. ","index":"00049","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nreason for both of these issues are the low wages. Not only are ECEs underpaid\nin relation to the scope of their expertise and what they bring to society in\nvalue, they cannot see a future where wages are going to improve. And that it\nis a direct result of the decisions made by this province. Advocacy cam�paigns\nregarding awareness of this crisis are not new. They've been going on for\ndecades. ","index":"00050","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Our\ncurrent government has frozen operating grants and parent fees for many years.\nThe two main revenue streams for a non-profit child-care centre are our parent\nfees and our government-funded operating grants. With both of these streams\nremaining stagnant now for a fifth year in a row, child-care centres like mine\nare in crisis. And it is our workforce, our edu�cators, who are bearing the\nburden of this crisis. ","index":"00051","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Their\nsalaries account for 85 per cent of the operating budget for a child-care\ncentre, and those are&nbsp; remaining frozen. We can't even afford to give them\na 2 per cent annual increase for cost of living, and that's on top of their\nunbelievably underpaid salaries. And this is unacceptable. Our workforce is\nlosing trained early childhood educators in droves because they can't\nfinancially support themselves and they can't financially support their\nfamilies on these wages. And that's after completing a two-year training in a\npost-secondary institution. What other profession has barriers like this? ","index":"00052","speaker":""},{"html":"����� This\nisn't a case where, upon graduation, ECEs can't find a job. Centres are\ndesperate to hire them. Most centres in Manitoba are operating on provi�sionals\nright now because they can't meet their trained staff proportions. The case is\nthat, even though these jobs exist, the ECEs coming out of colleges can't\nafford to take them. They can't afford to live off that small of an income.","index":"00053","speaker":""},{"html":"����� This\nworkforce also includes many untrained child-care assistants or CCAs. They have\ncompleted a 40-hour course, which an extremely brief overview of early\nchildhood education. What builds up their skills and knowledge is time in our\nfield; it's working in licensed child-care centres and being mentored by\ntrained ECEs. But we are losing the many outstanding CCAs we have during this\nworkforce crisis, as their wages are just above minimum wage. ","index":"00054","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Minimum\nwage is intended for entry-level jobs at workplaces that do not require years\nof service or skill-building and knowledge bases. Yet, our CCAs, who have been\nworking tirelessly in our child-care centres for five, 10, even 15 years can\nliterally make more money if they go work at a fast-food restaurant. Our\ntrained ECEs, who have gone to post-secondary school, can make more working at\na grocery store. This is unacceptable, and everyone in this meeting and across\nthis province should be outraged by this.

This needs to change because it's\nthe reality of our workforce, a workforce that is proven to be funda�mental to\nthis Province's ability to both respond to and bounce back from this current\npandemic.","index":"00057","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Over\nthe last 12 months, the government has routinely described non-profit\nchild-care centres as, quote, independent businesses, end quote, which I find\nincredibly misleading to the public because we cannot take the same steps and\nactions that a business would take when they face a financial crisis. If a\nsmall business goes into the red, they have options: they can increase their\nprices, they can downsize their work�force, they can create flash sales or\nmarketing campaigns to bring in more customers. That is what we, the public,\nthink of when we think of businesses.","index":"00058","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But\nnon-profit child-care centres have none of these options. Our revenue is fixed,\nwhile our expenses continue to rise; rent, utilities, insurance, supplies,\nmaterials, all increase annually yet our bud�gets stay the same, which is why\nour workforce remains underpaid.","index":"00059","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nonly thing we can do is fundraise and seek donations. But a business model that\ndepends on fundraising for financial stability is not sustainable, yet that is\nwhat child-care centres have been left to face for decades.","index":"00060","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I do\nwant to make one very clear point here. This financial crisis cannot be solved\nby moving this burden onto Manitoba's families. That is what Bill 47 is\nproposing. A family with two children attending preschool in Manitoba right now\nis already spending 22 per cent of their net family income on child-care fees.\nThat number is too high, and that is making child care unattainable for many\nfamilies.","index":"00061","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Bill\n47's proposed plans are the last thing directors like myself want to see\nhappen. We don't think it will help our centres and we don't think it will help\nour families. What our sector needs is long-term, sustainable and dependable\ninvestment not just from the federal government but from the provincial gov�ern�ment\nas well. We need our elected officials to start viewing child care as a\nfundamental right of children and families, and that it is a social service\nthat is just as worthy of investment as infrastructure, health care or the\neducation system.","index":"00062","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We\nneed Manitoba's government to step up like they've asked us to do during this\npandemic. There are other options out there to modernize our child-care sector,\nsuch as progressive pricing. That will not only meet the needs of the Province\nfor their fiscal planning but the needs for our sector, for our workforce, our\nfamilies and the kids.","index":"00063","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Bill\n47 moves our sector towards privatization. After months of being told that\nprivatization was not the goal for child-care in Manitoba, this bill and the\nnewly released KPMG report make it clear that that is the goal. Publicly funded\noperating grants going to private businesses, the ability to sell and purchase\nlicences and potential deregulation of school-aged child care is not what\nManitoba needs. It will spell disaster for the quality of care and education\noffered.","index":"00064","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Private\ncompanies offering child-minding ser�vices, such as the example of dance\nstudios given by the Minister of Families, is not quality early learning and\nchild care. ","index":"00065","speaker":""},{"html":"����� What\nis quality? It is programs operated as non-profits to ensure affordability,\nstaffed by trained, well-compensated early childhood educators following\ncurriculums based on pedagogical research and best practices, with small group\nsizes and licensing regu�lations to ensure the health, safety and full develop�mental\nneeds of each child are being met.","index":"00066","speaker":""},{"html":"����� What\nis child-minding? It is warehousing children. It is a large group size staffed\nby untrained, unexperi�enced workers for minimum wage. It's what I call the\nlifeguard approach. Staff are there to ensure the kids all get home safe, but\nthat's it. There is no education. There's no intentional, play-based inquiry.\nThere's no curriculum coming from observed interests. There's no focus on the\ndevelopmental growth of social, emo�tional, cognitive or physical development.\nIt's simply babysitting, and it's a place to leave your child until you're\nready to pick them up. It's a holding spot.","index":"00067","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Accessibility\ndoes not only mean the ability to secure a child-care space. It also means\nbeing able to afford that child-care space. Privatization would lead to drastic\nincreases in parent fees. Bill 47 would move our sector towards privatization\nand away from non-profit child care. Families would not be able to afford the\nsubstantially higher child-care fees even if spaces do become available. It\nwon't matter if families have more choices if they can't afford those choices.

One, just a reminder for Laura that we have capped parent fees for\nthree years, and we certainly�our government has certainly never referred to\nchild-care sector as a busi�ness. In fact, we recognize the challenges that the\nchild-care sector has undergone throughout the pandemic and, in general, before\nthe pandemic. And that is why we recently put in $4.4&nbsp;million to stabilize\nthe sector by wiping away the deficit of more than 200&nbsp;non-profit centres.","index":"00076","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We\nalso established a 11 and a half million dollar sustainability trust as a new\nrevenue stream for child-care centres and are investing�budget '21 invests\nrecord level investments of $25&nbsp;million more per year in the child-care\nsector than any other government in the history of the province.","index":"00077","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nso, with those record-level investments and new funding streams, we certainly\ndo recognize the importance of the child-care sector.

And I certainly do agree with Ms. Burla, as she\noutlined some of the challenges in the sector, and that's why we are proposing\nto streamline that certification process for early-learning and child-care\nproviders to ensure that the qualified staff can get into the workforce faster\nand enable that concept of career laddering into the sector, to address the\ncurrent gaps.","index":"00079","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Right\nnow, we know that there's the 40-hour program, in comparison to the two-year\nprogram and really nothing in between as a jumping-in point, and we've heard\nthat some of the workforce practicum programs are incredibly beneficial. And\nthat is something that we're looking to utilize more often.","index":"00080","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I\njust wanted to ask Ms. Burla if she thinks that there needs to be more career\nladdering into the sector to address the current gaps and if she thinks that\nwork�place practicums could provide part of that solution.

It's premised on an\nunfounded belief that our non-profit model is to blame for an inadequate number\nof spaces, the constraint of parent choices and limited service deliveries�and\nin my expert opinion, this a wrong diagnosis, making Bill&nbsp;47 a wrong\nprescription.","index":"00098","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I'll\nmove through a number of elements of concern. I'll start by saying that under\nwhat can be licensed as ELCC services in Manitoba is opened up&nbsp; by this\nbill in ways that are problematic. The provincial press release that\naccompanied the bill declared that, under proposed legislation, other learning\nand child-care providers beyond centres and family homes will be eligible for\nlicensing.","index":"00099","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nwe, I suppose, have to wait for regulations to see what these new classes of\nprescribed service will be, but undoubtedly, these are monumental changes to\nthe service landscape, and I would ask what these classes of service are.","index":"00100","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I'll\npoint out that under current legislation and in all other jurisdictions, it's\nthe facility that's the pro�vider of ELCC, and yet Bill&nbsp;47 suggests that\nthis will be persons, which I do not take only in the corporate sense. I assume\nthis language is purposive. I find it opaque. It must have an intended effect\nand I would�and I expect others would like to know what that intent is.","index":"00101","speaker":""},{"html":"����� A\nsecond point is that public spending on for-profit and unlicensed child care is\nboth inefficient and risky. Currently, under existing legislation, only\nnon-profit corporations can receive grants, and under the new legislation, that\npresumption will be reversed. ","index":"00102","speaker":""},{"html":"����� It would\nalso enable grants to be paid to much broader range of recipients.

And that is what we saw play out during the pandemic in our profit-driven,\nlong-term-care facilities.

For\nme, this term&nbsp; also brings up the fact that child-care workers are just\nabout entirely women, and many are Black, Indigenous or people of colour.

I am, in fact, owner-operator of a private preschool, and I just\nwant to talk about how divisive that can be because we're really focused on\ninclusion, and this bill focuses on a lot of wanting to be inclusive. And so\nwhat I want to say is, as a private centre, I don't think there's value in\nfurther creating a divide. I'm not here to suggest for one second that\noperating grants for anybody isn't important, although that's not the way we\nsustain our business, and we rely on parent fees, we have the same challenges,\nwe have the same struggles in staff retention, in training, in spots for parents.\n","index":"00635","speaker":""},{"html":"����� One of\nthe things I want to address specifically is that because we are a private\ncentre and because we don't take taxpaying dollars to operate, we are also not\nallowed to take inclusion markers. So in my time as a�I've been in this field\nfor 25 years in some capacity or another; I've had the pleasure of owning my\nown preschool for eight�but in my time, the amount of conversations I've had\nwith parents who have inclusion workers in place, who aren't able to access our\nprograms simply because we're a private centre, it's heartbreaking. When I have\na parent who has a subsidy in place who'd like to choose our program, they're\nunable to because we're a private centre. So I&nbsp;think that needs to be\naddressed because, again, I&nbsp;understand the way a not-for-profit model\nworks. I&nbsp;understand the importance of good-quality child care. I don't\nthink that it's safe to say or fair to say that as a private centre our\nstandards are less. We follow the same rules. We follow the same guidelines. ","index":"00636","speaker":""},{"html":"<i>Madam\nVice-Chairperson in the Chair</i> ","index":"00637","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We\nfollow the same ratios. We have a curriculum. We have all the same things that\na not-for-profit centre would have in place, and I don't want to be divisive\nanymore. We are child-care workers. We are early childhood educators, and we\nare here because we're passionate. ","index":"00638","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I\ndidn't fall into this job; I chose it. I didn't fall into this career; I chose\nit. I chose it because I believe in it. I also believe strongly that the staff\nthat I have and the fees that I charge that go towards paying the staff that I have\nare worth just as much as anybody else. ","index":"00639","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nregardless of where they choose to work or the�of choice, why are they\ndemonized because it's a private centre? I can assure you that quality is the\nutmost importance, and I think you could�you'd be 'emiss' to find any parent of\nthe 40 students we have enrolled that would tell you otherwise. We take a great\ndeal of care and concern over the children, and it is never been profit driven\nfor me, and I can tell you for sure it's not profit driven for my staff either.\n","index":"00640","speaker":""},{"html":"����� These\nare a dedicated group of women; we've been together a really long time. Our\nmodel's a bit different, so in Montessori, we all have to really be able to com�municate\nwithout even speaking. So we know each other, and I would�it would be�I would\nbe 'emiss' to say that they don't deserve the same respect as anybody else. ","index":"00641","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so\nit worries me. It worries me, this divide that's been created. It worries me\nthat people are under the impression that because we're private that we don't\nprovide a quality program. What providing a quality program means is investing\nin your staff. I would love to be able to send my teachers to further their edu�cation.\nIn fact, I had one teacher want to remortgage her home because we don't have\naccess to the same staffing grants as a not-for-profit. ","index":"00642","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nnow, I have a woman who wants to be an E-C three; she wants to go through the\ntraining, but she can't because she has to remortgage her house. That, to me,\nis inequitable. And so, although I would never ask for an operating grant\nbecause that's what the parent tuition is for, what I'm begging for is equality\nfor my staff, equality for the children I teach, equality for the families. If\nyou're going to support one sector to do training, to do�for PPE, don't give\nthe private centre the money; it's never been about that. Provide it to the\nparents, provide it to my staff; they shouldn't be punished for choosing to\nwork for us.

When people walk through the door and they look at me and say, good\nmorning, Ms. Megan, and the family says to me, it feels like home here, that\nmeans something to me. And I didn't do that for the money. I did that because I\nbelieve in the education of children; I believe in giving them a good start,\nand I&nbsp; believe in the staff that I've employed; they are valuable, and\nthey are worth it, and they are worthy of support. So not to the centre,\nperhaps, not to the business that I am, but to the staff and to the children\nand to their families, please give them the same access to these government\nsupports.

In fact, this freeze is ridiculous. I don't understand it. I mean,\nit's hard enough for us to do it without raising fees because that's been an\nintegral part of our piece as well. I can't look at parents in the face in a\npandemic and say you have to pay more because I'm not eligible for the same\nsupports as everybody else. The deal is that child care has been a mess for a\nlong, long time, and the structure needs to be changed.

I'm just asking for the same respect. And I want people to\nunderstand that just because we're private doesn't mean there's no quality, and\njust because we're private doesn't mean it's a dirty word.

And I can tell you first-hand, with\ngreat intentions, these people were lovely, but they always were worried about\nthe dollars that were coming in the door. Consequently the staffing was a\nrevolving door because they only ever paid minimum wage. One of the centres has\nto have an ECE II or III as a director. They designated one of their staff as a\ndirector and she had no idea that she was a director. The owner just made her\nthat on paper. They often were short on supplies, whether that be health and\nsafety supplies like first-aid kits or arts and crafts supplies. And it was\ndifficult. It was difficult because they only could rely on parent fees. ","index":"00934","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I am of the mind that public\ndollars should not go to private entities, though. That, as a citizen, I don't\nwant my tax-paying dollars to go to private businesses and for them to make a\nprofit off the backs of children. That's just not acceptable to me. And I see�I\nsaw it first hand that it just didn't work. ","index":"00935","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, my�sometimes I find that\nparents are having to go to private centres, using it as a transitional measure\nuntil they can get into the quality not-for-profit centre that they want to get\ninto. And they're always very happy when they get called from our centre that\nthey get it�that they've got a spot. ","index":"00936","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, again, when we look at how\nmuch of a non-profit child-care budget goes towards staffing and wages and\nbenefits, it's approximately 80 per cent of the entire budget, and the revenue\nsources coming into&nbsp; the non-profit is parent fees at approximately 60&nbsp;per\ncent, operating grant, and then fundraising. And I'm embarrassed to tell you\nthat I have been fundraising for my own wage and the wage of my staff for\n30-something years, and there's only so many chocolate bars I can sell. And\nthat's the truth. ","index":"00937","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And I�I'm going to, within\nfive years, probably retire, but what I want for my staff is to be able to have\na solid pension plan named in the bill that we know is going to move forward\nand go forward for them, and we want to give them decent living wages. It's so\nimportant. That�we love those children, but love doesn't pay our bills, and I\nknow that our parent fees have been frozen for eight years now. And this\ngovernment is proposing another three years for parent fees. I think that's\nwonderful for our Manitoba families, but, boy, do I wish my cable bill would\nfreeze for 11 years.

I know some of\nthe children I see as an SLP have parents who work hard to make ends meet. The\nincreased fees of private daycare will quite simply break them. The children\nwill be pulled from child care, parents may be forced to leave their jobs or cut\ntheir hours and instead of children having the opportunity to be with their\npeers, they will stay at home.

The first is: who is\nthis bill designed to benefit?

Some centres, like the one I'm currently in, have\nvery low rent because they're already in a public centre, like a school. So is\nmodernization to provide operation grant funding that&nbsp;&nbsp;is equitable\nto centres taking into account the cost of rent? I don't see that included in\nBill 47.

In the back�ground document for this bill, there's the example of\nenabling 1,000 families to access new spaces from private child care, thereby\nopening 1,000 non-profit spaces to new families, which would theoretically\nenable the first 1,000 families more�or the second 1,000 families more\nopportunities to enter into the labour market.

The free market will never build\nequitable access to quality services. We need to be investing in our non-profit\nchild-care system, not introducing more for-profit spaces.","index":"01186","speaker":""},{"html":"����� My\nfourth and final question is why is this government choosing to provide small\npockets of money to early child care instead of increasing the operating grants\nto all facilities in a way that will permit early childhood educators to be\nproperly compensated for the imperative work they do?

And so\nwe are moving more things into the act, which is why Bill 47 is longer than any\nprevious act on child care.","index":"01194","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And we\ncertainly recognize that some of the provisions that were previously in\nregulation, moving it to the act to ensure a consistent application of the law\nwill reduce duplication and it makes for a bit of a longer act, and that there\nare certainly other things that are in regulation that deal with matters of a\nlegislative matter that are subordinate to the main principles of this act.

I find it insulting and disheartening to know that you are planning\nto create unlicensed spaces�like gyms and dance studios�with staff that have no\nformal training in guiding and child development. How can you say and prove\nthat you are providing quality care to these children and families? One of the\ninvestments you can make towards childcare is to provide funding to train and\nretain staff. Creating more spaces to solve the childcare crisis won't solve\nthe problem if you do not have the staff to run those spaces.

I think it is\nalso important to note that Operating Grants have been frozen since 2016 as\nwell.
