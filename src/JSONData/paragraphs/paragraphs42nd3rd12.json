So, there's a confusing logic there which I'm hoping the\nminister can help to bring clarity to.","index":"00720","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, I\nask the minister: How does he resolve those tensions where at one time he's\nsuggesting that we need to have Hydro workers bear the brunt of these wage cuts\nto keep our rates low but at the same time he's proceeding, along with his\ngovernment, in forcing a 2.9 per cent rate hike on Manitobans?

And,\nquite frankly, that's exactly what not only Manitoba Hydro staff and leadership\nare working towards, they're working towards ensuring that we can come out of\nthis.

So Manitobans will actually never know the answer\nto that.

And that was because the\nindependent experts at the Public Utilities Board determined that there was\nactually no need for a rate increase of 7.9&nbsp;&nbsp;per cent, that that was\nfar in excess of what was required in order to allow Hydro to service its\ndebts, and so, as a result of that decision, all Manitobans had $60 million a\nyear put back into our collective pockets, put back onto our collective kitchen\ntables, in the parlance of this government.
