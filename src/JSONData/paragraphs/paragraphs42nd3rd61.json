This could have\nhappened in January or December, and we've heard from many different Manitobans\nabout the the difficulties they were having reaching vaccination sites. There\nwas numerous stories in the media about it and that they were having a hard\ntime getting time booked off.","index":"00525","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nit's not like this was a problem that they just discovered. This has been\ntalked about for many, many months in Manitoba, and if this would intro�duced\nin a more timely manner, in a more sincere manner, we could have had more\npeople vaccinated and more quickly. And that would have mitigated what's\nhappening now where we are the second highest COVID rate in all of North\nAmerica. ","index":"00526","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nnow this government said, you know, they haven't received any feedback�negative\nfeedback from Employment Standards, but in fairness, this govern�ment's track\nrecord on listening to Manitobans isn't been�great. You just have to look at\nthe education review and how the government completely ignored all the\nrecommendations in there and wasted more money, and did nothing that was\nactually recommend�ed from that report.","index":"00527","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, if\nthis government believes this bill is so im�por�tant, then it basically shows\nthat permanent man�datory paid sick leave is important. And, of course, this\ngovernment, if we came with a bill tomorrow putting in permanent sick leave,\nthey would say no. And they're only agreeing to this because it will obviously\nexpire with COVID, but it shouldn't, because the logic remains the same. ","index":"00528","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nwhy Manitobans just need permanent paid sick leave is that when you have a sick\nemployee who's forced to come to work, they have the potential to infect their\nentire workplace, making more employ�ees sick, making more lost hours of productivity.\nAnd that it's actually in everybody's interests, including business owners, to\nhave this in place full-time, even when the pandemic is over, so that we\nactually keep our healthy�our workplaces healthier, we keep all of our\nemployees healthy and our businesses running more efficiently, and less\ndisruption, especially during flu seasons.","index":"00529","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now,\nManitobans have built this province into what it is today.

Rather than the program being mandatory, as\nI've already said, the voluntary issue, that's critical. That has to change and\nit shouldn't be up to an employer to decide whether or not a paid sick leave is\ngoing to happen to their em�ploy�ees. That's a recipe for disaster. ","index":"00532","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nwhen this government has been questioned on this issue in the past, we've seen\nwith the Finance Minister, he's repeatedly dodged the questions and instead\nmentioned how, you know, 52 per cent of Manitoban employers already offer paid\nsick leave, but that's not good enough.

","index":"00534","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And,\nyou know, it's also going to be an issue that Manitoban workers deserve to go\nto work feeling safe. So, it's not just about the sick person, it's also about\nthe healthy worker at their workplace and that they deserve to be able to have\nconfidence going into work, knowing that a co-worker isn't going to get them\nsick and land them in the hospital.

So that's kind of where the problem\nstarts, I guess.","index":"00544","speaker":""},{"html":"����� You\nknow, this is�I guess the best we can hope for from this government is a\nhalfway measure that does something, as opposed to their usual story of either\ndoing nothing or figuring out what they can cut.","index":"00545","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now,\nduring the question and answer part of the presentation here today, we talked a\nlittle bit about workers, perhaps recent Canadians and workers in precarious\njobs, that�what is their knowledge of the Labour Board?

","index":"00547","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(15:50)","index":"00548","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nthe way the government has structured complaints at the Labour Board, there's\nno guarantee anymore that they'll even get heard, because that may just be one\nof the things that the deputy minister or whoever's in charge decides is a\nfrivolous complaint, so no point hearing it, no point listening to it, no point\nmaking a record of it.

","index":"00549","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And I\nget that the minister and perhaps many of his colleagues don't understand the\nconcept of shift work and family care while doing shift work and split shifts\nand working three different jobs to try and make ends meet while this\ngovernment continues to freeze wages and refuses to pay a decent wage for\nminimum wage�it's not a living wage. I get that the minister doesn't grasp that\nwhole concept. ","index":"00550","speaker":""},{"html":"����� He\nalso doesn't grasp the concept of life outside the confines of the city of\nWinnipeg. Not every location has a supersite, so the ability for workers to\naccess vaccinations becomes a whole lot more limit�ed. And certainly, earlier\non in the piece, when they announced days that the sites were going to be open\nand then cancelled them and then re-announced days and when you phoned to make\nan appointment it was the gong show, to say the least, because the people that\nwere answering the phone didn't know even if there were clinics that had been\nadvertised on specific days in some of those communities. Just makes it that\nmuch harder for those workers to make an appointment, and to make an\nappointment that maybe fell outside of their work time but also fell outside of\ntheir need to do child care and their need to do other things. ","index":"00551","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nnow the minister says, well, okay, you can have this up to three hours�it's not\nthree hours; it's up to three hours�but you may have to supply proof to your\nemployer. Well, I don't know�and I asked the mini�ster during the\nquestion-and-answer part, what is acceptable or what's going to be deemed\nacceptable as proof? Well, he didn't really know that. I guess, I mean, you\ncould take a picture of yourself getting vac�cinated, I guess. We've seen\npeople doing that. Well, that'd be proof you got vaccinated, but it certainly\nwouldn't be proof that that was the only time you can get vaccinated. ","index":"00552","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\npart of the problem is this government believes that workers are generally\nuntruthful, that they would go out of their way to fabricate the fact that the\nonly time they could get the vaccine was during work hours. So now they may\nhave to supply proof. ","index":"00553","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nwhen the employer says, well, whatever you showed me, yes, you showed me that\nyou went for a vaccine on this day, how does that prove to an employer who\nwants to be that way that that's the only&nbsp;day they can go? Well, it\ndoesn't. So right away, it puts the working people at the disadvantage again\nand, particularly in some workplaces, it puts them in the power imbalance\nposition again, that everybody assumes off the top that they're dishonest and the\nworker's not going to have any concept of what that proof is, so it's going to\nbe just too confusing, too onerous, so they just won't get vaccinated.

He could've\nalso put some retroactivity clauses in there so that working people that have\nalready had to miss work and didn't get paid would get paid. Didn't do any of\nthat. ","index":"00555","speaker":""},{"html":"����� When\nwe talk about paid sick leave, and there's something like�what is it�52 per\ncent offer paid sick leave.

","index":"00556","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I'd be\nsurprised if any of the workplaces that have paid sick leave�I should not say\nthat, because I know a workplace I came out of, if you were an hourly worker,\nyou had to be off for�at the time I think it was five days�and then you'd get\npaid for three of them. If you were in management, yes, you got paid from the\nday you didn't show up. You got 100 per cent makeup. ","index":"00557","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nagain, it's that power imbalance.
