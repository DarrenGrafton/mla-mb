We trust that\nmoving forward, this Legislature will do the right thing for our shared\ncommunities and constituents. At this juncture, it is not too late to\nreconsider how Bill 71 is at all possible. There is time for every member of\nthis Assembly to understand that the true significance of what it will mean in\nterms of the sustainable support of our students and schools both now and in\nthe years to come.

This has been based on the belief that public education is a\npartnership between the provincial government and local communities; both who\nsee its value and contribute directly to ensuring our students receive a\nquality education.","index":"00103","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Investment\nin future generations is essential to both our province and our communities,\nthus is a shared endeavour. Having the ability to generate local funds also\nenables communities to contribute to the unique circumstances existing within a\ngiven juris�diction.

It would occur once the provin�cial budget was\nbalanced and would take place over a&nbsp;10-year period. We recognized this\ndirection as ambi�tious and also prudent.

It would happen over a 10‑year period of time once\nthere was fiscal stability, yet we are also waiting to see the actual details\nof how this would be achieved. While school boards and municipal councils who\ncollect the revenue were anticipating some consultation, knowing that elim�inat�ing\none source of revenue would require another source of funding to ensure schools\nwould continue to be adequately funded, the scope of property taxation simply\ntoo great to not be replaced.

The current homeowner rebate or\neducation property tax credit of $700 given to municipalities to offset the\neducation tax portion is directly taken off the individual homeowner's tax\nbill.

That's how other jurisdictions raise revenue, through property tax for\neducation, like Alberta.","index":"00115","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nother concern with rebates is it shields the actual cost of education. Should\nthe amount of money that's put into the rebate system in Manitoba be put\ndirectly into education funding the school divisions, and therefore remove the\nrebates completely?

The faster that we can put money in the pockets of\nhomeowners and potential homeowners, both for them to enable�to be able to\npurchase a home and to maintain their homes and the spinoff value to the\neconomy of that money being circulated, I think, is going to be very, very significant\nin terms of the economic recovery after the COVID pandemic.","index":"00172","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nfirst-time homeowners are affected dramati�cally by the amount of education tax\non their property. You may�for those of you who've recently gone to get a new\nmortgage will recognize the fact that one of the things that the lenders look\nat, along with the costs of the property and your income, they look at your\nexpenses in terms of operating the home. And part of that expense calculation\nis the taxes that you pay on your house, and the property tax portion basically\nreduces the ability of the borrowing power of a first-time buyer. And this is\nnot a problem that is isolated. ","index":"00173","speaker":""},{"html":"����� You\nhave to recognize that in Manitoba this year, we'll probably sell between 15\nand 18 thousand residential properties; vast majority of those will be people\nwho are buying their homes for the first time.

On a typical home in\nWinnipeg that's assess�ed at $350,000, the percentage of their equity is roughly\n5 per cent of that, so it's roughly $17,500-$18,000. They are paying almost 25\nper cent every year, based on their equity in the home. If you've had a\nmortgage recently, you understand that a typical mortgage is a 25-year\namortization. But for the first 15 years, typical purchaser, homeowner, is\nreally reducing the interest; you don't start to reduce the principal and\nincrease your equity in the home until after the 15 years.

I know\nyou're, you know, someone that talks about low-income individuals, and so, you\nknow, I think there is people that are low income that are still homeowners.\nThat could be someone, maybe a stu�dent or, you name it, that's there.
