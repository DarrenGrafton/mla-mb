I\nthink, for example, considering some of the cases in other provinces where\npeople with disabilities were dis�criminated against by their employees, is the\nfact that there is going to be now a cap of $25,000, mean that employers can\nthen make choices with regards to, maybe there's a cost savings of firing\nsomebody, and they know that as a maximum, they'll only have to pay $25,000.

","index":"00381","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Bill\n63, as we know now, proposes important amend��ments to two separate acts: The\nPetty Trespasses Act and The Occupiers' Liability Act. ","index":"00382","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\namendments to The Petty Trespasses Act replace Manitoba's existing trespass act\nwith two categories of offences. There's, first, a general offence that makes\nit an offence to enter, without permission of the owner, occupier or tenant or\nwithout lawful excuse, a fully enclosed premises, partially enclosed property\nwith signage or other indications of an intent to exclude others, construction\nsites and other listed premises, or (b) an offence of ignoring a request from\nthe owner, occupier or tenant, other than those cover�ed by the general\noffence, to not enter the property or refuse to leave when asked to leave. ","index":"00383","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\ndifference between the offences is that when the general offence applies, the\nowner, occupier or tenant of the premises will not have to confront the\ntrespasser and ask them to leave, in order for their presence on the property\nto be a trespass offence. This is important. The law in Manitoba now requires,\nin this context, for the owner or the occupier or tenant to verbally or\notherwise warn an individual. And we believe that removing that clause or that\ncapability makes everyone safer. ","index":"00384","speaker":""},{"html":"����� This\napproach clarifies and simplifies the definition of when trespassing occurs,\nmakes it easier to request police assistance in appropriate circum�stances. It\nreduces the danger inherent in potential conflicts between landowners,\noccupiers and trespassers. ","index":"00385","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We\nheard tonight numerous presenters talk about their concern about those negative\ninteractions between landowners and trespassers. And so we believe that this\nbill reduces the dangers inherent on those interactions by reducing the need\nfor confront�ation, and by reducing that need to demand to leave the property. ","index":"00386","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In\nterms of amendments to the The Occupiers' Liability Act, those amendments will\nprovide occu�piers of premises with greater protection from civil liability for\ndeath, injuries and property damage suffered by people who are on their\nproperty without their knowledge or consent. And while we didn't have people\nspeak tonight to that part of these amendments, they are equally important. ","index":"00387","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Currently,\nthe The Occupiers' Liability Act provides that occupiers of premises owe the\nsame duty of care or level of civil legal responsibility to criminal and\nnon-criminal trespasses as they owe�trespassers as they owe to persons who have\npermission to be on the property, despite the fact that the act imposes a lower\nduty of care in relation to ATV, off-road vehicle operators and people who are\nhiking, for instance, on recreational trails. ","index":"00388","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nthe lower duty of care still requires the occupier of the premises to not\ncreate a danger with the deliberate intent of doing harm or damage to persons\non their property.

These amendments streamline decision making in the\nsystem by moving the authority to dis�pose of complaints from the board to the\nexecutive director.

","index":"00490","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\ncriminal property forfeiture process continues to be a critical tool in the\nfight against organized crime in Manitoba, and in many ways, Manitoba has led\nthe way in using civil means to take the profit away from those who commit\nunlawful activities.

","index":"00491","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I'm\npleased to bring amendments through this bill that would help improve\noperational efficiency to the Criminal Property Forfeiture branch.

","index":"00492","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Some\nupdates are necessary in keeping with court decisions in the area of civil\nforfeiture.

There is a risk that potential applicants may choose to\npursue their human rights claims before the courts, where possible, in order to\nobtain a greater award of damages in the civil context. It is worth noting that\nthere remains some contention as to whether complainants can pursue claims of\ndiscrimination or harassment via civil litigation (i.e.&nbsp;whether there\nexists a common law tort of discrimination or harassment, see Seneca College v\nBhadauria, [1981] 2 SCR 181). Notwithstanding this, one of the purposes of\nManitoba's human rights system is to provide an efficient, inexpensive and\nexpert forum for adjudicating human rights matters. By introducing a statutory\ncap on damages for injury to dignity, feelings and self- respect, this may\ndiscourage complaints through our system and cause complainants to pursue civil\nremedies before the courts, where such a forum is available to them.","index":"00557","speaker":""},{"html":"2) A legislated cap may limit the\nability of Adjudicators to account for inflation in assessing awards in future\nyears. In the context of civil litigation, the \"rough\" upper limit on\nnon-pecuniary damages is adjusted for inflation (see Lindal v. Lindal, [1981] 2\nS.C.R. 629) and the Ontario Superior Court has held that the rough upper limit\ndoes not apply to intentional torts � in this case, assault, sexual assault and\nother misconduct of a sexual nature . This not only affirms that assessments of\ndamages are context dependent, but also that establishing a \"fixed\"\nlimit, such as a statutory cap, risks artificially low awards that do not\nreflect present financial conditions.","index":"00558","speaker":""},{"html":"3) A legislated cap may limit the\nability of Adjudicators to account for particularly egregious, long-lasting or\nserious circumstances of discrimi�nation, and may not allow for adjudicators to\naccount for complainants in particularly vulnerable circum�stances.

Joe Singer Shoes Limited, 2018 HRTO 107, emphasizes the vulnerable\ncircum�stances that some complainants may find themselves in.","index":"00559","speaker":""},{"html":"4) The legislated cap will further result\nin incon�sistencies and misalignment in remedial awards across Canada.

For\nexample, an individual who experiences racial profiling in a consumer setting\nmay not incur financial loss but would undoubtedly suffer an injury to their\ndignity, feelings and self-respect. In other words, injury to dignity is not a\nloss that is ancillary to the range of harms that are caused by discrimination.","index":"00561","speaker":""},{"html":"6) A legislated cap may have a\nparticular impact on the rights of persons with disabilities, particularly\nthose in need of reasonable accommodation. Capping damages for injury to\ndignity, feelings and self-respect may encourage employers not to pursue\naccommodation on the basis that incurring a potential liability under The Human\nRights Code is less costly and more convenient than pursuing a complex, higher\ncost accommodation (for example, alterations to a built environment).","index":"00562","speaker":""},{"html":"While we are not aware of the policy objectives\nthat the cap on damages is attempting to achieve, we are surmising that the\ngoal is to ensure that damages under this remedial heading remain reasonable\nand proportionate.","index":"00563","speaker":""},{"html":"While this is an understandable concern,\nwe note that there is no evidence to suggest that damages for injury to\ndignity, feelings or self-respect are disproportionate or unreasonable under\nthe current statutory regime.
