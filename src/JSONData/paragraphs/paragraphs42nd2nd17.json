So it's nice for us to be able\nto talk about offering some protection around allowing workers to refuse work\non Sundays, even though they're required to give a full two weeks in advance of\nthat, but it's also clear that this bill doesn't go far enough. It doesn't go\nfar enough in protecting the rights of workers to ensure that they can plan\nwith their families, that they can know with certain when they're going to be\nworking weeks in advance.

Now,\nas it is described here, it gives workers rights to refuse work on Sundays or\nholidays. Now, if you can imagine workers on Sundays not�refusing to work. Now\nthe employer has a responsibility to backfill in those hours. Now, who's going\nto be backfilling in those hours? Is this going to cause a shift in the way some\npeople are scheduled where they'll always have to be working Sundays because of\nsome peoples' choice to refuse to work on Sundays? ","index":"00679","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now, is this a consequence that the minister has considered? Well,\nhe hasn't addressed it. Again, another gap in this bill that the government has\npresented for Manitoba.

That part-time work, is it going to be creating another 'instable' job\nsituation for an individual in our economy? And I would argue that it's quite\npossible it could. And I think that that's not the approach that any economic\ndevelopment plan should be promoting.

If you look at many\nminority groups�again, those minority groups were not consulted for this\nbill�they see more likelihood of working in the retail sector than in\nnon-minority groups. They see a higher likelihood of working in jobs with\nprecarious work hours. Perhaps they might even see themselves working as\nprivate contractors instead of actual employees, and therefore they wouldn't\neven qualify for this bill, which, you know, as I'm describing and many of my\ncolleagues are describing, needs to be improved.
