Article&nbsp;26, subsection 3 of the United\nNations international declaration on human rights, of which Canada is a\nsignatory, states, and I quote: \"parents have a prior right to choose the\nkind of education that shall be given to their children.\" The world's\nfoundational human rights document does not just affirm parental engagement but\nstates it as a right and specifies parental choice and, by implication, input\ninto their children's education as a human right.

Section 29, subsection (c) of the UN\ndeclaration on the rights of the child states the following, and I quote:\nparties agree that the education of the child shall be directed to the\ndevelopment of respect for the child's parents, his or her own cultural\nidentity, language and values for the national values of the country in which\nthe child is living, the country from which he or she&nbsp; may originate and\nfor civilizations different from his or her own. The UN here recognizes the\nimpor�tance of fostering a relationship between parents and education.","index":"00293","speaker":""},{"html":"����� A\nthird reason we may support parental en�gagement in education is to support\nIndigenous rights. We must learn from past mistakes.

Last month he stated in an interview: These child-care programs I've\nlooked at are only successful when they turn on the parents. That's the secret:\nengaging the family.
