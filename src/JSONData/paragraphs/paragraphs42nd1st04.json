That is not a new\nfacet; that is a description of our system going back for many, many, many\nyears. ","index":"01134","speaker":""},{"html":"����� As I\nmentioned previously, when you even think about the way doctors practise�unless\nthey're contract doctors directly in the employment of a regional health\nauthority or other entity, then those doctors are actually fee-for-service\ndoctors, which means they are essentially working as independent contractors to\nthe system.

","index":"01136","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I\nwould say to the member that it doesn't matter if you are Manitoba,\nSaskatchewan, Alberta, BC, Quebec, Nova Scotia.

I think they might even do medically ordered breast reductions\nand other services as well, and have for years. ","index":"01139","speaker":""},{"html":"Under the NDP government, this private array of\ndoctors incorporated under this company name Western Surgery Centre provides\nservices into the public system, as did the Maples Surgical Centre under the\nNDP, in contract and in agreement with the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority\nand Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living.

","index":"01140","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So our\nsystem is a mix of private and public provision of service, and we are\nun-ideological about the ratio of that mix. But what we are adamant about is\nfocusing on outcomes, focusing on getting better results, focusing on driving\ndown wait times, focusing on creating capacity, focusing on co-ordinating our\nhealth-care centre to focus on patients.

Like I said, this should all be the focus on�it should all be for the\nfocus on patient safety, on getting more quality procedures in our system. When\ngroups of doctors incorporate, the benefit to our system is that we don't have\nto pay for the capital to build a clinic for those doctors. If a group of nurse\npractitioners come together and have a practice, we don't have to pay for those\nnurse practitioners to hire their staff or to clear the snow, or to have\nsecurity, or to pay their property tax bill, or to do their taxes, or to meet\ntheir payroll. All of that risk and all of that activity's undertaken by them,\nand we can, in a simplistic way, a very streamlined way, enter into the services\nthat they would provide.","index":"01148","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I'm\nhappy to have a conversation about adding more capacity to the system in\ndiagnostics, adding more capacity to the system in laboratory.

And\ninstead, using analytics and data, using software and cutting-edge processes that\nwe are co-investing with�co-investing in with the federal government under a\nspecial stream, we're finding ways that we believe could be used to 'surveil'\nwhole populations in the North to determine who might be more at risk for the\ndevelopment of chronic disease, and then to be able to have services coalesce\naround them, counselling and public health and nutrition and other services.
