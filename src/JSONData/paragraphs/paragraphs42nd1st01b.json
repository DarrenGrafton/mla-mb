It has to do with preventing people from experiencing\nemotional trauma, emotional pain, adverse life experiences, adverse childhood\nexperiences, because the experts agree that addictions become an issue for\npeople who have some sort of adverse life experience and then don't have a\nhealthy means to cope with it, be that through therapy or, you know, perhaps\nreligion, social networks that they may find supportive.","index":"00507","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\ninasmuch as we do need to see action on detox and transitional housing and\ntreatment programs, we also need to keep an eye towards improving the justice\nsystem, the health-care system, the CFS system, housing in the province so that\nwe can be sure that we're mitigating those traumatic experiences that some\npeople experience.

The Western\nAustralia study that was released a couple of years ago was very interesting\nfor its observations.

But the report talks about the\ndanger of using reference to, for example, you know, fewer needles on\nplaygrounds or in neighbourhoods as a measure. If there are fewer needles on\nplaygrounds and in community areas found, then there are very likely going to\nbe a direct correlation of fewer needles distributed.

","index":"00615","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nit's a focus. It's an issue which the member has raised and, obviously, I share\nhis concerns that we look for the best possible ways to address it.

","index":"00617","speaker":"Wab Kinew"},{"html":"����� And\nso, certainly, and this is something that I've had, you know, conversation\nabout with community leaders too, is that, while rightly there is a great deal\nof emphasis on responding to methamphetamines today that perhaps we shouldn't\nlose sight of the impact of problematic alcohol use and problematic use of\nother substances along the way because many folks and many families need help\nwhen it comes to those issues as well. ","index":"00618","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\njust wanted to put that on the record because certainly the lion's share of the\nmedia attention is on meth, but VIRGO report<b> </b>and others suggest that,\nyou know, alcohol and other drugs continue to be a major scourge on many of our\nfamilies, many of our communities, many of our loved ones, so we got to keep an\neye on that as well. ","index":"00619","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And I\nthink that's why the focus on prevention can be positive because the flip side\nof the corollary between using prevention to attack multiple different\nsubstances is an insight that was shared with me by some experts in the field\nof addictions medicine. And they said that the reason why they don't like the\nterm meth crisis and they prefer to talk about addictions crisis, is they said\nbecause today it's meth, few years ago it was pills; prior to that it was maybe\ncrack, and then before that it was alcohol, and maybe even before that it was,\nlike, sniffing or something like that. And they said and what underlies it all\nis just like the baseline life experience that drives somebody to addiction,\nand they said that's why you need to deal with that sort of baseline condition\nif you want to see progress in terms of the prevalence of addictions in our\nsociety. ","index":"00620","speaker":""},{"html":"And an example that they gave, that kind of illustrated it neatly for\nme, was they said that's why you can go to a community that's a dry community\nand still find addictions manifested either maybe through, you know, sniffing\ngas or sniffing paint, something like that. ","index":"00621","speaker":""},{"html":"Their argument was, basically, unless you address the underlying\ncondition, it's not necessarily the substance, though certainly some substances\nlead to way worse acting out and way worse behaviour. They said unless you deal\nwith the underlying condition, you're still going to have people finding\ndifferent ways to get high or different ways to try and self medicate,\ndifferent ways to try and deal with the mental health or addiction that they're\ndealing with.","index":"00622","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I\nthink that that's all important to keep in mind. And then in terms of keeping\nan eye on the different indicators, we certainly did talk about public safety\nand public health and some of those other issues, prevalence of needles in the\ncommunity. But I think there's also probably some other indicators that we may\nnot be able to neatly capture in statistics such as how many tents are there\nunderneath bridges or in public parks today as opposed to a few years ago,\nright? I'm not sure that we have an accurate count on that, though that's\nprobably one of the more visible signs of the meth issue that we're facing in\nthe province right now. ","index":"00623","speaker":""},{"html":"And, conversely, you know, if we were to see progress, then very likely\nwe would probably see less people camping out under bridges and camping out in\npublic parks. And I think we all want to see that. Does seem to be humane.","index":"00624","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I'm\ncurious about all that, but just sharing some comments on the record because I\ndo think it's important to focus on that prevention piece. You know, if you�and\nI'm not speaking you to the First Minister, to be clear to the Chair; speaking\nyou in the general�if you were to bring about a Manitoba where there were kids\nwithout traumatic childhoods or without adverse childhood experiences, if you\nwere to create a province where people didn't, you know, have painful\nexperiences on the job site or in other places, then in that world, which may\nseem very tough to imagine from our current starting point, perhaps we could\nbring about a Manitoba without addictions. So I think that, again, that sort of\nthought exercise is useful in informing at least some of the work that we can\ndo around prevention. And, again, that prevention work's important because not\nonly does it suggest that we could have some answers and some action on\nmethamphetamines, but it would also deal with the problematic use of other\nsubstances like alcohol or, you know, other drugs that we don't want to see\nyoung people or people of any age to be using.","index":"00625","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I\nfigured I'd just make some unsolicited commentary as we're drawing close to the\nend of our session here and just leave those thoughts on the record.
