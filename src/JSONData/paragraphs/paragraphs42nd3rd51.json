And for some others, they said that the\nproblems with staffing, the patient-to-staff ratio, were so unmanage�able and\nterrible that even when they would get offered more hours, they wouldn't take\nthem because they knew that they would hardly be&nbsp; able to provide, you\nknow, decent care for their patients and also that they just wouldn't be able\nto get through more work, more hours in their day. ","index":"00708","speaker":""},{"html":"����� It's just been\nthat bad at some of these facilities.

Quebec\nlast year announced that they are going to spend an extra $100 million annually\nto boost home-care services for the elderly and other Quebecers with reduced\nautonomy. The province was facing increased demand for home-care services due\nto its rapidly aging population and, of course, that demand increased during\nthe pandemic, which killed as many as 4,000 residents in Quebec in regulated\nlong-term care homes.
