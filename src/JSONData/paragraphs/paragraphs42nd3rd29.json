","index":"00766","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now,\nMadam Speaker, I think it's really important for us, when we're looking at this\nbill, to be able to reflect on the government's decision-making to date in\nterms of spending during this pandemic. ","index":"00767","speaker":""},{"html":"And it's important because the government has failed in so many ways,\nand so for us to be able to reflect and put these words on the record and ask\ntough questions is a part of, hopefully, this government doing some listening;\nhopefully, this government taking into consideration the information that we\nshare, so that, moving forward, they make better decisions, they make decisions\nthat support all Manitobans, that they stop leaving Manitobans behind from many\ncommunities. ","index":"00768","speaker":""},{"html":"����� You\nknow, a good example, Madam Speaker, would be that this week we finally saw\ndata released�race-based desegregated data that's been collected during this\npandemic. ","index":"00769","speaker":""},{"html":"And it's important for us to be able to look at this data that's been\ncollected, look at the communities�of which we know Black, Indigenous and commu�nities&nbsp;&nbsp;of\ncolour are disproportionally impacted by COVID‑19. It's important for us\nto be able to understand how dollars that are going to be spent and further\ninvested in health care and navigating this pandemic and education, how are\nthose dollars going to positively impact the communities that we now know have\nbeen most negatively, detrimentally impacted by COVID‑19 during this\npandemic. ","index":"00770","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Those\nare totally valid questions. Those are important questions, Madam Speaker, to\nbe asked and answered with transparency, with clarity from this government in\norder to reassure Manitobans that those folks who we know are being so impacted\ncan trust that this government is going to put their interests in mind as we\nmove forward, that they can trust that this government is, in fact, learning\nand has learned from their own mistakes during this pandemic. ","index":"00771","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nMadam Speaker, you know, when I think about in my own role as critic for\nHealth, the state of our health-care system leading into this pandemic, I have\nto reflect on the concrete data, the numbers that we knew of in our health-care\nsystem leading into this pandemic. ","index":"00772","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I\nlook at numbers like the fact that the difficulties that may have been\nmitigated, had the&nbsp;&nbsp;government invested adequately, before the\npandemic, surrounding staffing in our hospitals is a good example.

","index":"00775","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I look at numbers like critical care at Health Sciences Centre: had\na vacancy rate for nurses of 31&nbsp;per cent. Emergency care at St. Boniface\nHospital had a vacancy rate for nurses of 28 per cent. These are all vacancy\nrates that we talked about in this House, in committee, in question period many\ntimes before this pandemic ever reached Manitoba. These are all vacancy rates\nthat were not addressed by this government.","index":"00776","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In fact, Madam Speaker, leading into this pandemic, I think it's\nfair to say that this government unfortunately did further harm to the\nrelationships with our front-line workers, to the point where they had very\nlittle trust�quite frankly�that the government would protect them once this\npandemic reached Manitoba. ","index":"00777","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And unfortunately, I have to say those concerns from those\nfront-line workers were validated once this pandemic reached our province. ","index":"00778","speaker":""},{"html":"����� It is incomprehensible to me that our front-line workers�who have\nbeen working, under this govern�ment, exorbitant amounts of mandated overtime\nhours, see their families less and less, had their jobs cut from underneath\nthem and forced to work at other hospitals that were nowhere near where their\nkids went to school, where they'd bought their homes and situated their\nlives�went into a pandemic without the adequate protection that they deserve\nand that they were assured by this government they would receive. ","index":"00779","speaker":""},{"html":"����� This government�we all stood up, sat down, participated in this\nChamber to make sure that this government had access to the dollars that they\nneeded in order to make sure our front-line workers were protected, and Madam\nSpeaker, they failed.","index":"00780","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I'm going to give a couple of really concrete examples. I don't\neven think I'm going to get into how nonsensical it was that the government\nspent $425,000 on a ready set go�sorry, Madam Speaker�a Ready. Safe. Grow. HR\ncampaign while giving our front-line workers expired PPE that put them at\ngreater risk while providing care to Manitobans during the greatest health\ncrisis of our lifetime. ","index":"00781","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I won't get into where that $425,000 or some portion of it could\nhave been better spent and allocated, but what I will talk about is the\nmillions of dollars, Madam Speaker�millions of dollars�that the government\nordered in PPE: $13&nbsp;million worth of N95<b> </b>masks for health-care\nworkers that failed to fit requirements�$13&nbsp;million spent on PPE N95s that\ndidn't even meet requirements. ","index":"00782","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And that Minnesota company sued the Province of Manitoba for an\nadditional $6&nbsp;million, claiming the total for the deal was\n$19&nbsp;million worth of masks, of&nbsp;&nbsp;masks that failed to even fit\nthe adequate requirements, which is just totally unacceptable. That's a\nsubstantial amount of money. ","index":"00783","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I don't know about you, Madam Speaker; I have never seen\n$1&nbsp;million, never mind $13&nbsp;million and toss on six that they were\nactually were supposed to still pay us. That's a lot of money that could have\nbeen spent certainly much more responsibly.","index":"00784","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I think it's also really important for us to reflect upon the fact\nthat even when health-care workers were finally able to use their best\nexpertise and decide�our front-line workers in hospital�how they can use N95s,\nthat came after a significant amount of back and forth&nbsp;&nbsp;and, quite\nfrankly, tensions between front-line workers and the government in order for\nworkers to be able to use their best judgment and expertise in deciding when\nthey can don that PPE. ","index":"00785","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So it is shocking to me that after that back and forth, after\nworkers raised their voices, made their needs heard, demanded that right, that\ninstead of them being able to put on that PPE, keep themselves safe, the\ngovernment said: You know what, we're gonna�we're not only gonna�we're gonna\nsend you the wrong PPE, we're gonna put you at greater risk, you're gonna think\nyou're safe and you're gonna go to work and put yourselves at risk because\nwe're failing to protect you.
