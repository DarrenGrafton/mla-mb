Jon </b><b><a name=\"_Toc57964511\">Gerrard</a></b><b>�(River\nHeights):</b> A few words on the resolution, one that we support because people\nwho are vulnerable are having a lot of difficulty right now and we think that\nthe best would be for the government to make the changes, as BC, the Yukon and\nNorthwest Territories have done, and continue so that CERB would not be\nconsidered as income under EIA. ","index":"00320","speaker":"Jon Gerrard"},{"html":"����� Let me\ngive you a story. This is an individual who was chronically homeless for many,\nmany years; finally was able to achieve a home, accommodation in 2016 and it\nmade a world of difference to him. This year he was on CERB and EIA and he is\nnow being asked by EIA to pay back the CERB payments and it will come at $300 a\nmonth. ","index":"00321","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now,\nhe's on EIA, and if you claw back $300 a month from his EIA, it is quite likely\nthat he will end up homeless and destitute. It doesn't make any sense at all,\nwhat this government is doing. If there has to be a clawback, if there was no\nother way, it should be extended over a much longer period and be no more than\n$25 a month. But even that $25 a month is a lot of money for somebody who's\nliving marginally on EIA. ","index":"00322","speaker":""},{"html":"And so we need a government which has got some compassion instead of\ntrying to give impossible bills to people who are on EIA who can't afford to\nhave $300 a month taken away from them. ","index":"00323","speaker":""},{"html":"����� There\nare, you know, a number of issues that I'd like to raise in terms of EIA, which\nis not operating very well�needs more staff. Access to EIA is a challenge;\nintake is waiting three weeks. This is ridiculous. As people can appreciate,\naccessing systems is very challenging for those living along riverbanks, in\nstairwells, in derelict buildings, in encampments, in bus shelters. Rapid\naccess to EIA is&nbsp;&nbsp;a critical step to successfully linking people who\nare homeless to any level of housing.","index":"00324","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\ncurrent EIA intake system is not user-friendly for those who live homeless.\nAccess to EIA is currently remote, requiring individual calls to request an\nintake appointment. Many, if not most experiencing homelessness don't have\naccess to a phone. ","index":"00325","speaker":""},{"html":"Further, the current public health order has closed public spaces that\nmay have otherwise allowed homeless individuals use of phones or computers to\nconnect with EIA or other supports. Those providing street-level services to\nthis population also face challenges. Thrift stores are being closed, when\nthat's one of their vital access to health and to clothing.","index":"00326","speaker":""},{"html":"����� COVID-19\nprevention protocols prevent the sharing of cellphones, and privacy legislation\nrequires direct communication between EIA and the EIA applicant. Under these\nconditions the current EIA system and its processes have become a significant barrier\nto assisting those who, more than any other time in our living history, need to\nbe able to access systems on an immediate basis. ","index":"00327","speaker":""},{"html":"The government needs to act urgently and swiftly to get rapid access to\nEIA. The system is not working right now. There needs to be, within 24 hours,\nimmediate access to EIA, and then individuals can, hopefully, get housing\nbeyond that. But getting EIA is&nbsp;&nbsp;so critical, and access to housing\nrequires EIA, essentially, and so without EIA functioning well, we have a big,\nbig problem.","index":"00328","speaker":""},{"html":"����� One of\nthe results of the lack of people who are homeless having access to EIA and to\nhousing is that COVID now appears to be spreading rapidly in the homeless\npopulation. We understand that, of the isolation units, the first two blocks\nare now full, and that 140 units�or 138 additional units are now being\navailable.

The government is\nnot taking account or reporting the number of people who are associated with\nhomeless shelters or are homeless in their accounts, so that the people who are\nhomeless have become not only homeless, they have become nameless in the\nreports being provided by the public officer of health.
