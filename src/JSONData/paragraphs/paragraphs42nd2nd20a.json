They must occur in a timely manner.\nWe're having a lot of farmers with crop damage and stuff as result of dams.\nWater backs up on the land, drowns out alfalfa fields, for example. If a beaver\ndam is just off of a person's property and on a piece of Crown land, the water\nstill backs up on the farmer's land and it's�it takes a long time and it's very\ntime-consuming to get the permits through. ","index":"00011","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And there's nobody that knows the watershed more than the local\ngovernment.

Many of the\npeople working minimum wage jobs are women with children, and many of them are\nworking multiple jobs to make ends meet. Certainly, in the constituency that I\nrepresent, many of those folks are over the age of 50, new�comers, working two\nand three jobs, earning poverty wages, can't even find a place to live because\nthere is no affordable housing�social housing being developed. And, you know,\nlet's hope that they don't require any sort of hip or knee replacement where\nthey can't even access, you know, in-patient physio or occupational therapy.\nThey're going to have to go home and try and figure out a way to pay out of\npocket when they're earning barely a living wage.
