This would\ncreate a single, provincial agency responsible for liquor, gaming, cannabis and\nnow horse racing industry. As many of the regulatory functions from the\nManitoba Horse Racing Commission are similar to those of the LGCA, we believe that\nthe LGCA is well-positioned to add horse racing to its regulatory framework.","index":"00733","speaker":""},{"html":"����� As a\nmodern regulatory agency, the LGCA is able to draw on its vast experience\nregulating the liquor, gaming and cannabis industries to establish a risk-based\napproach to regulating the sport of horse racing.","index":"00734","speaker":""},{"html":"����� At\nthis point, Madam Speaker, I should probably also mention the fact that I've\nappreciated my interactions thus far in this role with the LGCA, with its\ndirector. I have appreciated their attention, at a board level, to issues of\nimportance in Manitoba. Right now, many Manitobans will know that they have\nlaunched a very significant and important consultative process with Manitobans\nand I believe that Manitobans are getting excellent service by this board.","index":"00735","speaker":""},{"html":"The member for River Heights (Mr. Gerrard) had spoken earlier this\nafternoon about the need to appoint good people to boards. We're very, very\nproud of our record in this government through agencies, boards and\ncommissions. The appointments that we have made�I believe it was only days ago\nin this House that we referenced the fact that we have reached aggressive\ntargets for the appointment of women, of Indigenous persons, of minority groups\nto Manitoba's boards, agencies and commissions. Far more, multi�tudes more than\nthe previous government ever did.","index":"00736","speaker":""},{"html":"We are proud of this work but we are not yet done and so we will\ncontinue to tap on the shoulder, through the appropriate means, those\nManitobans who can and choose to give back to their communities their\nexpertise, their background, their knowledge of gover��nance, who do great\nwork, including at the LGCA. As a matter of fact, I believe that just recently\nwe appointed some new members to the Liquor, Gaming, Cannabis Authority and we\nwish them well as they assume their new duties and come alongside those members\nwho are currently functioning in that capacity.","index":"00737","speaker":""},{"html":"So Madam Speaker, a risk-based approach to regulation also reduces red\ntape for the industry. It provides assurance to the spectators who watch and\nbet on horse racing that that racing is fair and that it is conducted with\nintegrity. Those things are important. Bill 31 supports this effort and intends\nto bring about regulatory improvements by reducing the number of licensed\ncategories, requiring only those occupations that could affect the integrity of\nracing be required to hold a licence, streamlining regulatory services to\nindustry, improving transparency in how appeals of racing decisions are\nconducted, clarifying how testing for alcohol and drugs is administered and\nreducing unnecessary administrative burden.","index":"00738","speaker":""},{"html":"Bill 31, as the legislation shows, also amends the Pari-Mutuel Levy Act\nwith the continued goal of supporting and promoting horse racing in the\nprovince of Manitoba.

This\nwill further reduce red tape for Manitoba's horse-racing industry.","index":"00739","speaker":""},{"html":"In considering this bill, I remind my colleagues in the Legislature that\nit is focused on modernizing the regulatory framework for horse racing, in\nsimplifying how the pari-mutuel levy is distributed. As a neutral regulator,\nthe LGCA will not provide advocacy or funding to the industry. The LGCA mandate\nwill be to ensure fairness and transparency in horse racing and oversee the\nconduct of racetracks that provide pari-mutuel wagering.","index":"00740","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Members\nof this House often speak to what consultations took place.

And we believe\nthat this bill accomplishes those measures. So, I am pleased to sponsor this\nlegislation in the House.
