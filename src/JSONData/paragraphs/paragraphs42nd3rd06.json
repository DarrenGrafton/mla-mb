I\nwould say that�I will say there are at least two things I can agree with, one\nof which is the changes to the payroll tax act, which is a very unfair tax,\nwhich has been very difficult; it was always which Manitoba Liberals have\nalways opposed.","index":"00831","speaker":""},{"html":"����� There are some important changes as far as expanding the\ninvestigating powers of the Auditor General. This is a major�I do see this as\npositive because one of the biggest problems in terms of where we go wrong, in\nterms of corruption or in terms of money and government money, public money\nbeing misspent, is when it goes into the hands of private contractors who can't\nbe looked at or investigated by the Auditor General.","index":"00832","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I mean, that's one of the things that this summer, when we were\ntalking to�when we had people to committee, whether it was Public Accounts or\nother committees, we're able to talk to people, deputy ministers and ministers,\nwhether it's Health or climate change or Infrastructure, or�and we were able to\ntalk to Crown corporations and their boards.","index":"00833","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But we're not actually able to talk to the private contractors\nwho�or consultants for that matter�who are very often absolutely critical to\ndecision-making, and also to implementation of programs and how money is being\nspent.

","index":"00835","speaker":""},{"html":"����� There are a few other major concerns, again, I&nbsp;mean, one of the�the\nfact that I'm not really certain that it's incredibly important for people who\nold�'gould'�gold and silver not to pay taxes on their investments. But the\nother is that the commitment to ongoing tax cuts, which are revenue losses, in\nthe middle of a pandemic, are an extremely serious concern because, ultimately,\nthese cuts are happening�or, these proposed cuts I addressed in my criticism of\nthe streets�speech for the throne, but I&nbsp;&nbsp;think they bear repeating.\nThere's�when you're running a deficit and you start to cut taxes, it increases\nthe deficit. It's not�this is basic math. ","index":"00836","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The�I talked to the Finance Minister about this. He seemed to have\na disagreement about what�how revenue�whether tax cuts count as reducing\nrevenue. And he sort of said, well, this is also Manitobans' money. ","index":"00837","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And I agree it's Manitobans' money. I think it might just be a\nquestion of perspective, that I happen to think that the government of Manitoba\nbelongs to Manitobans. ","index":"00838","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And that's one of the things that�there's a difference in that it's\nnot necessarily�in�opposed to Manitobans and Manitobans' interests, but when\nyou're talking about permanently reducing revenues during a crisis and reducing\nrevenues�it essentially means that we're borrowing to pay for�to lower the\nprices of the�of certain customers. That's basically�if we were running a\nbusiness, it'd be�if we're running a business in deficit that's losing money\nalready, we're going to go out and we're going to borrow more money and we're\ngoing to use that money to make sure that some of our customers don't pay as\nmuch on a permanent basis. That's what cutting taxes during a deficit does. It\nactually permanently hampers your ability to reduce revenue and one of the\nmajor causes of deficits and debts is not overspending; it's tax cuts. And it's\ntax cuts under this government. ","index":"00839","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I know that this government again has said�has committed to taking\neight years to balance the budget and they want to pat themselves on their back\nfor allegedly having balanced the budget this year. It was quite clear from the\nAuditor General that the budget was balanced. But what's been happening is the\ngovernment is presenting the�is pretending that the size of the deficit and the\ndebt is worse than it is, in order to justify ongoing cuts. ","index":"00840","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We're actually using our debt and our deficits to finance tax cuts\nthat only affect and benefit a very few while cutting spending and failing to\nmake investments in education, infrastructure and health care. And health care,\neducation and infrastructure are the foundation of an economy. They're not a\ncost. Very often, the Premier (Mr. Pallister) has said, some things don't cost;\nthey pay.

So, again, the�I think the most\nserious thing about this budget is that&nbsp;&nbsp;it really is not in any way\nthe kind of change this&nbsp;&nbsp;province needs and it continues under the\nmistaken assumption, I think, that the more we cut�that if we&nbsp;&nbsp;can�if\nwe just shrink the public sector, the private sector will grow.
