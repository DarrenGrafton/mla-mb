And so, here�s the update, though, that I'll bring for today. </span>","index":"00991","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� So, first of all, this�the issue of a pandemic response,\nCOVID-19 vaccine, is of crucial importance to all Manitobans. We have been\nengaged with the federal government for months in order to understand what the\nplanning was. I can tell the critic that, even in the early spring, there were\nalready preliminary discussions about where are we at as a nation. </span>","index":"00992","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� Of course, there were all those natural concerns about where's\na vaccine going to originate from; what will happen if vaccine is from China;\nwhat will happen if vaccine is originating from Russia; will North America\nentertain the idea of vaccine products that come from other jurisdictions. And\nwe saw very quickly in the western hemisphere that effort was catching up; in\ncontinental Europe it was catching up. Because there are, of course, political\nconsiderations, and I'm no expert in all of those, but we know that there is\napprehension, you know, in the world. </span>","index":"00993","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� And so I could indicate to the individual question that there\nis, indeed, a task force that has been set up that is specific to the responsibility.\nAnd in the planning for the epidemic response, there was dis-cussion as to\nwhere we would most appropriately locate that responsibility under individuals\nlike, of course, the MOH, the medical officer of health responsible for a\nvaccine, Dr. Tim Hilderman. </span>","index":"00994","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� And so a task force has been set up that has membership from\nHealth, Seniors and Active Living, public health, Central Services, in order\nto, of course, to consider all of those logistical considerations that must be\nconsidered. </span>","index":"00995","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� There is�this is a separate task force, will operate much the\nsame as our testing task force, which was charged with the responsibility of\nbeing able to quickly bring improvement to add numbers of sites and retrain\nworkforce and handle logistical issues and interface with health providers. </span>","index":"00996","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� So in the same way right now, there are many considerations\nwhen it comes to how we plan for a vaccine. Of course, first and foremost, we\nmust remain in contact with the federal government, because they are the ones\nwho must approve vaccine. We understand there are a number of global\npharmaceutical companies that, even here in North America, are close, some into\nclinical trials, some approaching clinical trials�essentially seven principal\nvaccine providers who are on the list of the federal government, who are\ninvolved in this work. The task force itself reports up to the clerk's COVID co‑ordinating\ncommittee here that has membership from various departments as well. </span>","index":"00997","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� Some of the logistics that have to be handled, of course,\nthough, are things like how we receive vaccine and how we store vaccine. This\nis not simply like&nbsp;storing supplies, textbooks or Band-Aids, like we do\nright across our system through the Manitoba distribution agency; rather, in\nthis case, this kind of vaccine could come with some very, very special\nrequirements for storage and some very, very&nbsp;&nbsp;complicated\ntechnicalities when it comes to distribution.

This causes me to think back to the ethical\nframework for decision-making on the distribution of PPE in the early days of\npandemic response, a broad document that had sign-on by all provinces and\nterritories in the federal government, that would provide a framework for\ndistribution. </span>","index":"00999","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(16:10)","index":"01000","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� </span>We know that our populations that are particularly\naffected may be the elderly in hospital, health-care providers, those whose�who\nreside in the North and others.
