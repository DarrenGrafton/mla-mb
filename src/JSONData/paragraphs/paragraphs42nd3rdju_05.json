Thank you for allowing me to speak.\nAnd this is a very important issue for us here at MKO and for our First Nation\ncitizens in the North. We believe that this report is essential and this bill\nis essential, imperative and that it needs to be recognized by health autho�rities,\nand on the number of health professionals that are required with special\ntraining to examine children who have been sexually assault and on sexual\nassault evidence kit inventory. ","index":"00037","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Sexual\nassault causes acute physical, psycholo�gical and emotional trauma to\nsurvivors, particularly child survivors. And this trauma can affect survivors for\ntheir entire lives, especially if they don't get the help that they need. We\nrecognize that too many women and girls who experience sexual assault or sexual\nviolence are afraid to report their experiences or testify in court, which has\nled to the widespread under-reporting of sexual assaults in northern Manitoba. ","index":"00038","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Sexual\nassault survivors need to be examined by&nbsp;&nbsp;specially trained health\nprofessionals, and evi�dence of sexual assault needs to be collected and\npreserved in the manner that furthers the adminis�tration of justice. Although\nthis process is necessary, it can be traumatic for many victims. We should be\nworking towards making this process as easily�easy as possible. However, many\nnorthern First Nation communities suffer from lack of specially trained health\npro�fessionals and sexual assault evidence kits. ","index":"00039","speaker":""},{"html":"����� This\nlack of resources disproportionately affects child survivors who are forced to\ntravel to Winnipeg for specialized medical attention that they require. This\ndrags out this process for victims, making it more traumatic for them. Often,\nvictims will have to fly all&nbsp;the way to Winnipeg without being able to\ntake a shower until a health 'professioner'�until a health professional gathers\nDNA evidence. ","index":"00040","speaker":""},{"html":"����� This\nis a real obstacle in finding perpetrators of sexual assault. It is already\nhard enough for many victims to report the result�report their assault due to\nfear and guilt. This lack of resources only makes more youth no longer want to\nreport their assault after learning that they must travel all the way to\nWinnipeg to do so.","index":"00041","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Travel\ncan also be expensive and time-consu�ming. Children need someone to take them,\nwhich can&nbsp;&nbsp;be very difficult to organize when parents and guardians\nhave to work. The purpose of this bill is to help children and young people in\nthe northern, isolated communities access crucial health care when they have\nbeen sexually assaulted. ","index":"00042","speaker":""},{"html":"����� This\nbill will require that the minister releases annual reports that break down\nhealth authority by how many professionals there are with special training to\nexamine children who have been sexually assaulted and the inventory of sexual\nassault kits must be available. ","index":"00043","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Access\nto health services is a right for all Manitobans, and the government must\nconsider northern First Nation children. And the government must be publicly\naccountable for failing to hire staff that have this special training to\nexamine children who have been sexually assaulted. ","index":"00044","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I hope\nthat this spurs us to take to action to ensure that northern children have\naccess to proper health professionals and evidence kits. ","index":"00045","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In the\nNorth, girls are more likely to be victims of sexual assault than boys. And\nyoung women and girls in the North are eight more times likely to be victims of\nsexual offence than males, so this is a very serious concern that I bring\nbefore you. So, when interpreting rates of sexual offences, it is important to\nrecall that only one in 20 sexual assaults are reported to police, and\ntherefore sexual crimes reported by police likely underestimate the true extent\nof sexual assaults and sexual violence against young women and girls. ","index":"00046","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(18:10)","index":"00047","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Sexual\nassaults have also have the longest delays in reporting, especially if they\ninvolve family mem�bers. So, the under-reporting of sexual results is because\nof the lack of resources, and the process is very cumbersome and we must take a\nlook at how can improve the status quo because it affects First Nations in the\nNorth, especially young children. ","index":"00048","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Nine\nout of 10 women do not report their inci�dents of sexual assault. They often\nfear police investigations and the court process is a deterrent to reporting.\nSo, rape myths and victim shaming has long kept women and girls from speaking\nout about their experiences. And unfortunately, remote northern community,\nManitoba child victims of sexual assault are faced with even greater barriers\nto reporting their assault due to not having the access to specially trained\nhealth professionals.","index":"00049","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, we\nshould be trying to foster an environment that encourages victims to come\nforward so that abusers face the consequences of the law. This is actually�this\nis exactly the predicament that many northern children face. When children are\nforced to travel to Winnipeg simply for law enforcement, to get the necessary\nDNA samples as evidence for them to get the help they need, it creates a very\nbig problem.","index":"00050","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, we\nmust commit ourselves, and MKO will stand up for and with women and girls who\nhave survived sexual assaults and sexual violence.

And if things aren't treated properly when an\nassault does occur, and it's not reported, or if it is reported and then they\nhave to go to Winnipeg, just the trauma of being sexually assaulted is bad\nenough, but to have to, you know, get on a plane with a bunch of people, or a\nbus, depending on how they're going to send people, and not be able to be\nclean, be showered, you don't know who's taking you because you don't know if,\nyou know, your mom or your granny or whoever, your dad, or whoever might have\nto take you.
