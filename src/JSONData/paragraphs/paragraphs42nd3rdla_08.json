First of\nall, I'm very concerned that this bill opens the door to more privatization of\nchild care, which has been shown to be likely to negatively affect the sector\nas a whole. It's not that I&nbsp; believe that any one particular for-profit\nchild-care centre is bad or has bad intentions, it's that we know, thanks to\nextensive research, that a publicly funded system can more reliably and efficiently\ndeliver high-quality care.","index":"00142","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In\nfact, as we've heard multiple times in the prece�ding presentations, there is\nresearch showing that for-profit care leads to higher parent fees, lower\nquality care and, oftentimes, even lower paid staff.

It's not unique to\nchild care, as a for-profit enterprise will work to do exactly what it's meant\nto do: earn a profit.

This\ncommittee has now heard over and over again about the meaningful difference\nthat quality child care can make to a family struggling with multiple barriers,\nnot only improving the child's outcomes later in life, but also as an important\npart of lifting entire families out of the cycle of poverty and oppression that\nthey're caught in. Creating truly equal opportunities for all children is an\nessential part of this government's duty to meaningfully address racism and\nsystemic equality in our�systemic inequality in our society.

To me, that does not add up.","index":"00146","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Like\nmost of the other presenters who have spoken, I agree with this government that\nwe need more flexibility in our system, and we certainly need more spaces.

I sat on their board and I know they were\ndoing their best to attract and retain quality staff. But when you're caught in\nthe financial position these daycares are in, with&nbsp;frozen parent fees,\nfrozen operating grants and little ability to fundraise because\n80&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of your families are relying on the subsidy to even\nafford daycare, what can you do?","index":"00152","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nnow I'm facing�sorry�and now I'm facing a new challenge as I navigate finding\nchild care for my now preschool-aged child, who will be attending kindergarten\nin the fall.

And all that is needed to make that happen is more funding.","index":"00157","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nidea that this bill opens the possibility that these non-profit providers could\nsoon be competing with private centres for these desperately needed public\nfunds is therefore very alarming to me.

So it seems to me that\nthis system is�what it's going to do is, you have people on one side with the\nmoney to pay for private care. And then you have the have-nots on the other\nside for not-for-profit. It is human nature for us to have these divisions.\nIt's human nature for us to consciously or unconsciously have this\ndivisiveness. ","index":"00242","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(14:10)","index":"00243","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And, so, my question is: do we really want to promote divisiveness?\nAnd I worry about the private and the not-for-profit that there's a division\nthere, and it's felt. It can be felt. ","index":"00244","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nfreezing of the parent fees. That's a wonderful idea. Of course, making child\nand youth care ac�cessible is fantastic. What I'm concerned about is the fixed\ncosts that continue to rise and rise. ","index":"00245","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Let's\njust start with food, which has substantially increased since the pandemic�and\nisn't that a little bit awkward. But there's hydro increases; there's rent\nincreases; there's supplies for the daycares�books, paints, paper, educational\ntoys and even computers. All these costs, the�you know, they�all of this costs,\nand each year it goes up more and more and more. So that is my concern about,\nagain, the costs. Where is the costs going to come from? ","index":"00246","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Decent\nwages for child-care workers. This is a career. Being a child-care worker\nworking in daycare before and after school, it's a career and it's essential to\nhave well-educated staff and that their wages need to reflect the work that\nthey do. And when we think about the work that they do, they're responsible for\nsix to eight to nine hours a day, four to five days a week, for the child's\nsocial, emotional and cognitive growth. And when you think about that, that is\nan amazing input into that child. That's lifelong. That's our future. So it's a\nserious responsibility, the influence that these career workers�women and\nmen�have on our chil�dren. ","index":"00247","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Again,\nI just feel that well-educated, well publicly supported, funded wages to the\nstaff directly from the government needs to happen. It is so sad when I hear\nabout daycares and daycare workers having to do fundraising. That just��that's\nnot their job. Their job is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the emotional, social, cognitive\nsupport of our children. Their job is to be that extension of com�munity, that\nextension of family to raise that child. ","index":"00248","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Grants\nand incentives are wonderful, but my understanding with working with grants is\nthere needs to be somebody applying for them and applying for them and applying\nfor them. The main responsibility of the child-care workers, as I've said\nbefore, is in that program with those children. So it's got to be very\ndifficult to constantly expect the daycare directors to apply for funding over\nand over. ","index":"00249","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nmonies, again, should be sustainable through, you know, a sustainable\ngovernment program�universal child care, which is what I'm talking about�and\nthat the goals and the costs are strong, that they run successful programs for\nall of these children and use. ","index":"00250","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And I\nhave to say, I don't understand why gov�ernments�and I'm going to put that in\nplural�continue to spend so much money studying child care when we have\nexamples of successful working universal child care around the world. Sweden,\nFrance�I mean, we can name a few. But, you know what's really amazing is within\nour very own province, we have an expert. We have Dr. Susan Prentice, who could\nguide us through a�towards a successful transition into a universal daycare.\nAnd I really believe that several of the presenters that have already spoken\ntoday, you can tell that there's many of them that could be brought together on\na committee, and I'm sure that a beautiful, successful movement into universal\nchild care is possible. ","index":"00251","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So in\nclosing�and I'm working with my com�puter�I believe that the government in\nManitoba�us taxpayers�need to contribute towards a universal child care which\nprovides quality education, good wages for child-care workers and accessible,\nafford�able child care for all who need it. We are investing in our future. The\nchildren who are in daycare today will be our future. They're going to be our\ndoctors, our grocery clerks. They're going to be our pharmacists, our\nmaintenance workers, our road constructions, our CEOs and future daycare\nworkers. ","index":"00252","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so\nI think it's really important that we need to think about this. ","index":"00253","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Something\nthat I've thought about for quite a few years�I did work in child care, by the\nway, in the '70s, myself. Feels like a long time ago. But something that has\nalways been on my mind�and I'm just going to make sure I've got this right\nhere�is that when we talk about end-to-end care, we have daycare in the\nbeginning and how those children, their experiences in the daycare, which I\nthink is really important. So, they have the experience. And then you move into\nelder care, and so it's a continuum. ","index":"00254","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So to\nme it's how we treat those children in day�care is, when in our turn, us\nseniors, our turn to need that support at the end of life, it's the experience\nthat they had in daycare that is going to help us go forward. So, if it's been\ndifficult or traumatic or they've lost staff, or they're�or it's not as smooth,\nor it's not as funded, decently, as it needs to be, well then what's going to\nhappen when it's their turn to be in charge of this? ","index":"00255","speaker":""},{"html":"����� You\nknow, we have to think about that end-to-end care. It's�so as daycare is that\ncontinuum of elder care, then let's put the money into it.
