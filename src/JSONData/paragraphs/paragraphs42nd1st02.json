One of the issues that we've heard about a ton is the use of\nmandatory overtime, particularly with nurses, but for other health-care\nprofessionals too. With nurses I think the concern is that at sites like St.\nBoniface Hospital, that mandatory overtime is being used rather than just a technique\napplied in extenuating circumstances where, for instance, a nurse walks into\noperating room for a surgery, the surgery goes way overtime, they get mandated\nto be there to oversee the surgery to its completion.

I would like to see mandatory overtime\neliminated because�except in those exceptional circumstances like a long surgery\nor perhaps a disaster&nbsp;that requires, like, an all-hands-on-deck type\nresponse. I do think it is important to eliminate mandatory overtime as a\nroutine HR procedure because it leads to a decline in the quality of patient\ncare. Nurses are forced to work excessive back-to-back shifts and, in many\ncases, forced to work back-to-back, and then with very short turnaround work\nanother back-to-back shift, and then very short turnaround work another\nback-to-back shift after that.
