","index":"00205","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nthe access that we have to those spaces begs another question, which is: how\ndoes the Province facilitate those kinds of experiences? How does, you know,\nManitoba make that happen? ","index":"00206","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nthe answer is variable. We've got provincial and national parks, places like\nFortWhyte Alive, Oak Hammock Marsh. Indigenous communities represent vast\nswaths of natural spaces in our province, and there's private land and Crown\nland. And all of these different categories are ways for Manitobans to engage\nand to experience the benefits of natural spaces in our province. ","index":"00207","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But\ntoday, because of the bill we're talking about, I wanted to focus on Crown land\nin particular. ","index":"00208","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nso, as it stands, the way I understand Bill 12 to function is that there is low\noversight on the designation and sale of Crown land in cases where Crown land\nis inexpensive. And the number given as it stands is $25,000. And what this\nmeans is that, at present, it's hard to sell Crown land. Central Services may\nbe challenged because those parcels are of greater value than 25 grand. ","index":"00209","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nso, if the Province wants to sell them, you know, that's a tricky thing, and,\nin response, we see amendments to this bill which shift that value, that\nthreshold, from 25 to 200 thousand dollars. And this means is�that parcels are\nmuch more easily sold because now as you look at the province, okay, what do we\nhave available to us�many more will qualify at that $200,000 mark as compared\nto the $25,000 previous one. And, in addition, this bill also has some\nprovisions which allow the designation to shift within the Province, between\ndepartments.","index":"00210","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nso, in general, we have the situation where Crown land can be more easily sold,\nand that begs the question: what are the implications? And I had a lovely\nconversation last evening with someone from Central Services, who explained\nthis to me, because I'd been on the phone trying to get a hold of folks to speak\nto for actually almost two months, to understand how this legislation works. ","index":"00211","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And I\nfound out that the motivation for this bill is in cases where a project has\nbeen done, let's say the Province wants to build a ditch. And so we purchase\nthe land, but we think we're going to build our ditch. We build our ditch and\nthen, after some time, you know, maybe we find out, okay, so there's these\nstrips&nbsp;&nbsp;of land beside the ditch and they're not ditch&nbsp;&nbsp;at&nbsp;&nbsp;present.\nWe're not using them. How do we sell them off? And so this bill will allow more\nparcels,&nbsp;like&nbsp;&nbsp;those edges, those table scraps, to be sold\nbecause they'll now fall within a much more general $200,000 bracket. ","index":"00212","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, in\nshort, parcels are more easily sold and, in addition, more parcels will become\nimmediately eligible within the province. And so this obviously�and, you know,\nI'm coming at this from a perspective of the natural spaces in the province,\nbut I also want to recognize I understand the utility here. I understand the\nvision to more easily commodify some of these parts of our province. But I\nthink that that mechanic is dangerous and it doesn't take quite take into\naccount all of the roles of the land in our province.","index":"00213","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so\nI wanted to speak briefly then, take a short case for Crown land, because when\nwe talk about�and the bill specifically discusses whether or not land has\nfulfilled its purpose, and when designations should be shifted according to the\nfunction, like, what is this land doing for us. And Crown land, even when it\nisn't designated for a specific project, is doing good work for Manitobans. ","index":"00214","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nthe first thing here�I've got a photo that you can't see but I'm sure you can\nimagine, of the marsh just south of Lake Winnipeg. That area is doing great\nwork for all of us every day. And we know there are issues with the nutrient\noverload in Red River, and all the reeds and marshes in that area are cleaning\nour water for us. They're doing an economically valuable job for Manitobans and\nfor the province.","index":"00215","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nsecond, Crown land, it provides an acces�sible source of nature for us, as\nwell. If you or someone you know tried to book a campsite over the last few\nweeks, you know how hard it is to get a designated spot in the outdoors. Crown\nland is freely accessible, and that's great. And it's only really valuable for\nthat natural experience if it is used for natural spaces. ","index":"00216","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nlastly, you know, something that we can't put a dollar value on as easily is\nthe biodiversity and ecosystem integrity that Crown land represents. You know,\nour province has a large amount of parkland, designated wildlife reserves,\necologically protected areas.

I want to emphasize to you that, you know, several of our\nministers have emphasized that our parks are not for sale and that is a basic\nstart to the whole premise. ","index":"00229","speaker":""},{"html":"����� What I\nfound when we first formed government was we looked back at�well, we looked at\nland sales that weren't occurring, and what was happening was it was taking\nfive years�95 per cent of time, was taking 5 years to get to no, you can't buy\nthe land; the other 5 per cent was�took a little longer. In fact, the first\nland sale that I came across when we were in government took 20 years for not a\nvery big parcel of land. The next one took 15 years. ","index":"00230","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nthose are some of the things that when land is deemed to be surplus and no\nlonger serves a purpose for the government, that we can, in fact, use this type\nof legislation to make it available to the public, to treaty land entitlement,\nto municipalities for their use. And usually when someone wants to buy a piece\nof the land, they might have a much better idea of what it can be used for than\nwe might as a government. ","index":"00231","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Mr.\nBalzer:</b> I think that, you know, part of why I'm presenting and why I wanted\nto raise this issue is because I think the term parks are not for sale,\nreflects specifically on designated areas within the province and that, because\nof the way this legislation is worded, that we should consider what it means to\nbe a park, and again what that job�those parks�are doing. ","index":"00232","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so\nmy concern, then, is that this is finding a way to sell things that work like a\npark but aren't protected like a park.

","index":"00233","speaker":""},{"html":"����� That\nsaid, I completely understand what you're saying and that there are, you know,\na variety of cases where it is important for the province to make those sales\nor make land available.

I think,\nquite simply, based on the mechanics of this bill, it seems as though the best\nway to protect biodiversity within the province is to provide more land with a\npark designation with official protections, because the change of designation\nfrom park to non-park�which then allows for Crown land sales�is a challenging\nprocess.

","index":"00257","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I\nlooked at the Bill 12 and I'm concerned about the provisions. It's been a\nlong-standing practice that the minister does have the power to sell Crown\nlands, and that's provision No. 6. And it goes along in the amendments to\nexplain that the minister can basically do as he wishes and sell a parcel of\nCrown land. ","index":"00258","speaker":""},{"html":"����� However,\nas was mentioned in the last presen�tation, Crown land has a lot of value to everyone\nin Manitoba, and it's important to recognize that value before there is a Crown\nland sale made. So, I think we need to consider a number of other things. ","index":"00259","speaker":""},{"html":"����� If we\nlook at the use of the Crown land, there are different uses. There's parks,\ncottages, agricultural Crown land, and in the case of agricultural Crown land,\nthere is a leasing system already in place for that. And it turns out,\nrecently, there was an auction system in place to transfer a lease from one\nholder to another. ","index":"00260","speaker":""},{"html":"This has resulted in a huge lease increase�lease fee increase to anybody\nranching on agricultural Crown land. The problem is the livestock market is not\ncovering ranchers' costs, making it very difficult for ranchers.","index":"00261","speaker":""},{"html":"����� If\nsome of this land is made for sale, it's still a problem for ranchers�very\ndifficult for them to afford possibly to buy agricultural Crown land. ","index":"00262","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And it\nwas mentioned, there's a lot of good things that can happen with ranching on\nCrown land, but if there's forest and sensitive plants and sensitive wildlife\ninvolved, that's a responsibility of the Crown. ","index":"00263","speaker":""},{"html":"And those are provisions that are important to all of us in Manitoba.\nAnd I think because of the increase in the lease rate fee, it should be easier\nfor the Province to provide advice and assistance to agricultural Crown\nlandholders and ranchers, when making use of their land and looking at their wildlife\nsituations. ","index":"00264","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nit's important to really get a grasp here: are we going to commodify the land,\njust take it over and do what we wish, as humans? All of that land, even my\nprivate land, is important for everyone on earth, here, considering the climate\nchange challenge that is before us. And so, it's really, really important.

And, you\nknow, as government, we believe that the public advertisement of the sale of\nland and the real estate through that�sale&nbsp;through that market is probably\nthe best way to ensure that there's value in the land sale and also in the\ntransparency of the sale, so that many people as possible know about that\npotential sale.","index":"00276","speaker":""},{"html":"����� It\ndoesn't behoove the government to try to sell it for the lowest cost to an\nindividual.

","index":"00277","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I\nwant to give you some confidence that we will make sure that we can get good\nvalue for money there, and also that, when the land would be sold, if it is\ndeemed to be sold, that, you know, there are other departments that have a say\nin what happens on that land after. I mean, Conservation and Climate still sets\nconditions on any development that might occur on that land, and MR�Municipal\nRelations�also has a role in that as well.

Does the provision now being put in here about mobility mean that people\nthat work for the civil service or whatever it is we're calling them these\ndays�does that mean they may be working in one department today, another\ndepartment tomorrow, and be bouncing all over the place�which leads to less\naccountability, less knowledge, less service to the public.","index":"00664","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, is\nthat what's happening here with this mobility, that the minister's\ncontemplating being able to employ less workers and just moving them all over\nthe place?
