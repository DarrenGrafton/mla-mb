As recently as a few years ago, I remember throwing sandbags\nsomewhere along the Assiniboine River with military personnel during a flood,\nand there's probably a lot of Manitobans who have similar memories and similar\nappreciation, as I do, for great people, the great men and women that work in\nour military, and their willingness to come here and offer their support when\nneeded.","index":"00364","speaker":"Brian Pallister"},{"html":"����� So\nit's a backup.

We know that it's a real hardship on our\nfront-line folks when they can't get a rapid test, because they'd like to be at\nwork.

","index":"00380","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But I\njust wanted to just share with the Premier, in case he hasn't heard this sort\nof advice, is that from some people on the front lines of our health-care\nsystem, they do expect capacity to be reached within Winnipeg hospitals and\nacross the Manitoba system over the next few weeks. ","index":"00381","speaker":""},{"html":"����� At the\nsame time, we see outbreaks happening in other areas, particularly in northern\nManitoba.

We stood up instant command, as you remember in the spring,\nrestrictions�with tremendous work from a lot of people, including our caucus\nmembers, who worked very hard on protocol development in various sectors in the\neconomy.
