","index":"00010","speaker":"Wab Kinew"},{"html":"����� Now,\nthroughout the pandemic, we have heard Dr. Roussin and Lanette Siragusa and\nothers who are engaged in the public health efforts make repeated calls for us\nto do some very important things: stay home when we're sick during the earlier\nperiods of the, you know, yellow and amber restrictions, and then, to stay\nhome, period, during the more recent code red restrictions.

All of these serve to cause confusion when it comes to the ability\nof Manitobans to abide by public health orders, and it also undermines public\ntrust. We can't afford that. ","index":"00013","speaker":""},{"html":"����� At a\ntime where there's anti-maskers, anti-vaxxers, disinformation campaigns under\nway to try and discredit the advice of public health experts, we need to give\nthem all the support that we can.

Earlier this summer, Dr.\nRoussin, during one of his important public health updates, he said\nunequivocally that in announcing phase 3, that there would be no more phases.\nNo more phases to our pandemic response system. However, it was about a week\nlater that the Premier (Mr. Pallister) came out and contradicted Dr. Roussin\nand said that, in fact, there would be an additional phase. There would be\nphase 4. And so that is one example of a clear contradiction and contravention\nof the public health process at work�interference at a political level by this\ngovernment. ","index":"00015","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so\nthis bill offers a simple and straight�forward remedy, which is to remove the\npoliticians' ability to interfere with the public health advice. So when this\nbill receives unanimous support�or, if it receives unanimous support, from the\ngovernment's side included�then we would have a situation in Manitoba where,\nwhen the Chief Provincial Public Health Officer makes an order, that it stands,\nthat it is no longer subject to ministerial interference and political\ninterference.
