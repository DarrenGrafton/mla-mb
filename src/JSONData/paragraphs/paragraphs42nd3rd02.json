We've\nasked people to forgo their visits with their family on�even on special\noccasions, and as we're coming up to another Thanksgiving weekend. It is a\ntime, I know, in my house I'd like to have all my family members�and there are\nmany of them�gather around a table and celebrate and break bread together, and\nwe know that this year will be unlike any other Thanksgiving where we are doing\nthings differently as we try to maintain relations with our family members and\nour community while keeping one another safe.
