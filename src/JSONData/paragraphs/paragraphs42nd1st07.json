We don't want to have apprehensions where they're not\nneeded, but we will�we have to look with that safety lens first, and so we'll\ncontinue to work with the authorities and agencies towards that goal. ","index":"01225","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Mr. Gerrard:</b> Yes, I would be interested if the minister could\nshare the statistics showing the number of birth alerts and how that they are\nactually going down. ","index":"01226","speaker":"Jon Gerrard"},{"html":"����� I'm quite concerned about this for a number of reasons. I remember\na young woman who had her child taken away at birth. She was breastfeeding. The\nchild was grabbed and taken away on day&nbsp;4. She was doing well. There was\nno good reason for taking the child away, as was proved in court some six or\neight weeks later. ","index":"01227","speaker":""},{"html":"And what do we want to make sure is that you have a\ngood opportunity for mothers and children to do well, and, you know, this\npractice of, you know, preventing mothers from breastfeeding, who have been�and\ndeveloping some of the attachment that is so critical to early childhood\ndevelopment, and I think that the�what I'm concerned about is that we really\nhave strong, valid measures being used in terms of the risks of children and\nthat in this case, the agency concerned had adequate opportunity to make a\nthorough and careful assessment before the child was born, and they failed to\ndo that. And they were nervous, as a result of not having made that assessment,\nand they went ahead and issued a birth alert and took the child away. ","index":"01228","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b> (17:40)","index":"01229","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I think that we need to make sure that the agencies are involved\nand make�taking preventive measures, looking carefully at and developing plans\nwith mothers. ","index":"01230","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I\nwould ask what preventive measures are being taken and what�so that mothers can\nbe supported properly and so that you decrease the chance of children having to\nbe taken away. ","index":"01231","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Mrs. Stefanson:</b> I thank the member for the question and we do take\nprevention initiatives very, very seriously, and we've been�I did mention in my\nprevious answer about our social impact bond, called Restoring the Sacred Bond\ndoula project.
