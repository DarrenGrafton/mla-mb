","index":"01989","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And clearly, for a number of\nreasons, having employees who are full-time at personal-care homes is\nbeneficial.

","index":"01992","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I believe that some private-sector\nhomes may tend to employ people part-time to get around some of the need to\nprovide benefits and feel that this is a cheaper way to do it, but I think that\nwhat we need to do is to look at the quality of care that is provided and the\nquality of care that is given and the relationships that are present with the\nstaff and the residents.","index":"01993","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The second point I want to make is\nthat it became apparent during the height of the pandemic that one of the\nthings that was happening was that people who were agency nurses�contracted\nnurses�would be working at more than one facility and that sometimes this may\nhave been contributing to the transmission of the coronavirus�COVID-19 virus.

","index":"02025","speaker":""},{"html":"����� This\nshifts the bias. The preliminary disclosure order requires the person to answer\nquestions about unexplained wealth. If a person, who earns $30,000 a year,\nlives in a place that costs $5&nbsp;million, it can be legitimate. It can be\nlegitimate. But sometimes, the proceeds of crime are used to purchase property.\nAnd so, in this case, it causes that person to have to answer questions and\nthen an adjudication happens to determine whether there is the suspicion of\ncriminality. ","index":"02026","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Besides\nthis, of course, I would want to indicate that the bill clarifies some\npresumptions. The court is to presume, unless the contrary is proven, that cash\nthat is found in close proximity to a controlled substance, or if cash is\nbundled in a manner that makes it clear it's not conventional, well, that\nshould be presumed to be the unlawful activity�presumed to be the proceeds of\nunlawful activity.","index":"02027","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Also,\npresumptions that a vehicle that is used to flee from a peace officer or a\nvehicle that contains restricted or prohibited firearms or a�controlled\nsubstances�maybe a vehicle that has a concealed container or compartment, those\nthings should be understood to be an instrument of unlawful activity, unless\nproven otherwise.
