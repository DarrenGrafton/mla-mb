It is clear to us that Bill 10 is\ndesigned to clear the path for further privatization within our public\nhealth-care system. The centralization of health-care service decisions in the\nminister's office and the elimination of oversight from medical and health-care\nproviders and service recipients will place cost savings or the promise of cost\nsavings at the centre of decision making.

Yes, my name is Elizabeth Dyer. My\n14-year-old son was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when he was 12 months old,\nas�just as a baby. I'm honoured to be able to speak with you tonight, and I was\nthrilled with the recent announcement for coverage for continuous glucose\nmonitors up to the age of 25 and also extending the coverage of insulin pumps\nto 25.

More often than not, we would exceed the 10\npaid-for strips because it was just not enough to get the full picture of how\nhis tiny body was reacting to the insulin we had to give to him four to six\ntimes a day. As careful as we were, he suffered from many low blood sugar\ninduced seizures. His first one was at 18 months old�multiple hospital <i>[inaudible]</i>\ncalls. ","index":"00779","speaker":""},{"html":"����� He was\nlucky enough to start using his pump when he was five, and this was\nlife-changing for him. This gave him freedom with his food. He didn't have to\ndecide between a snack or an extra injection. But more importantly, it meant\nthat we could disconnect or suspend his insulin delivery if he was suddenly\ndropping unexpectedly or decided to be more active or was in the middle of an\nillness or a growth spurt�this is my son Quincy <i>[phonetic]</i>�which both\ncause drastic changes in insulin needs. This is not possible with normal daily\ninjections. ","index":"00780","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Our\nlife really changed, however, when he started using a CGM. He rarely is able to\nfeel fluctuations in his blood sugar and has never woken up overnight when his\nblood sugar is low. Before he had a CGM, we would need to set our alarm\nmultiple times a night to check on his blood sugar, as some of his seizures did\nhappen overnight. Every night and morning I would walk into his room and I\nwould have a moment of terror and hold my breath, hoping he had not had a\nseizure that I had not heard and slipped into a coma�and he would still be\nbreathing.","index":"00781","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now\nhis CGM is connected to apps on our phone. It shows us not only what his blood\nsugar is in real time with a reading every five minutes, but how it is\ntrending. We know if it will stay steady for the next while or if it is about\nto crash to a severe low or skyrocket to a high blood sugar, both of which are\ndangerous. It will alarm us when this happens, so we no longer need to set our\nalarms overnight.","index":"00782","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Recently,\nas an added bonus, based solely on his CGM data, his pump will automatically\nshut off insulin delivery if his blood sugar is predicted to go low.

Having this technology is crucial for people of all ages, especially\nthose who are caring for young children, living alone and don't feel the\nfluctuations in their blood sugar.

So her average blood sugar was\naround mid-eight, which�it would put her at risk for all those awful\ncomplications that we heard tonight. ","index":"00834","speaker":""},{"html":"Exciting news, we got a insulin pump at the beginning of February and\nalready in a very short, short amount of time, around two months, it's dropped\nfrom mid-eights to mid-sevens. So, like, a full percentage point which, you\nknow, may mean something, maybe 1 per cent isn't a lot in diabetes, it now\nmeans that she is not at risk for long-term complications. So my four-year-old,\nif we maintain this and even get lower, I think we can get lower with her pump\nand CGM together, she can be healthy and not have all these�the kidney, the\nheart, the eyes, all those things for her whole life.","index":"00835","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Saying\nthat, at equity lots of folks have talked about is huge. Getting a pump right\nnow, we want all ages. We also need to look at pump criteria, which is really,\nreally important. So, right now, for the pediatric pump program, a lot of folks\ndon't realize this, you have to have really good blood sugar�relatively�to get\nit. Right now at the DER-CA clinic in Winnipeg, a lot of kids have over 10. So\nAnna <i>[phonetic]</i>, even at mid-eight, that's�that was not great but a lot\nof them, she was better than half the clinic. Kids in Manitoba have really poor\nblood sugars�and adults�but specifically kids. And so, to get a pump, you have\nto be under 10. ","index":"00836","speaker":""},{"html":"So at�we know so many families that can't afford a CGM and how this all\nrelates it's like the chicken and the egg, you need the CGM to get better blood\nsugars to get the pump. So, because I could afford to pay out of pocket $300 a\nmonth, I was able to keep Anna <i>[phonetic]</i> in a good blood sugar range,\nand we were able to get the pump and now with the pump it's even better. So\ntogether it's key. ","index":"00837","speaker":""},{"html":"So really need to look at the criteria for the pump program and CGM\ngoing forward, even for the expansion to 25 it shouldn't be that you have to\nhave great blood sugars to get a pump. In Alberta, you have to have really bad\nsugars to get a pump. So everybody�the pump is going to help.

Her\ndaughter is going to be in big trouble�not when she's 80, like when she's 20\nbecause her blood sugars are running so high all the time. If you don't have\nthe technology often they'll run kids really high blood sugars at school or in\nlife as an adult because you don't want to dip down as a senior. So a lot of\nfolks in Manitoba are running their blood sugars high on purpose because they\ndon't want to risk a severe low. That's scary. That is so scary. The severe low\nis scary, but the long-term implications are so scary also. ","index":"00839","speaker":""},{"html":"So once we had the CGM and the pump we were able to get it down, we're\nable to make a huge impact and I was finally able to breathe. Some people have\ntalked about mental health, so without a CGM, parents, adults, seniors, like,\nyou're waking up, you're pricking, you're not sleeping, you're not able to do\nyour best job at work, do your best job in life due to all of that, right? And\nas a adult, that's super hard. ","index":"00840","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now I\nknow I can sleep; I'll know the alarm goes off. Right now, I have her pump�like\nit's a whole digital thing, and you can see it�oh, maybe not. But I can see, so\nshe was running a little bit high, so I was able, on the pump, to adjust it\neven while she's sleeping to give her a little bit more insulin now.","index":"00841","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nelectronically, it's just amazing and it shouldn't just be kids that get this.\nSaying this right now, not all kids are even getting this. So we really need to\nlook at the whole pump program as a whole and make it equitable for everybody\nto get this life-saving technology. ","index":"00842","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And we\ncan't have hoops, we can't have hoops to jump through. Diabetes, already a\nmillion hoops, you're always watching, you're always on it.

I'd\nlike to share my experiences with that program and how I think Bill 10 could\nimprove it, especially when I read the findings of the Peachey report that Bill\n10 references. Ashley mentioned the barriers to accessing a pump through the\nprogram, and that's what I'll be expanding on. ","index":"00870","speaker":""},{"html":"����� When my son was diagnosed and still in the hospital under 24-hour\nwatch, we were taken for training in how to administer insulin. And that's done\nat DER-CA, which is the acronym for Manitoba's pediatric diabetes clinic, and\nit's located at HSC. They administer the pediatric insulin pump program.","index":"00871","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And I asked, well, what about getting an insulin pump, and our\neducator looked at just and just, she shook her head and said it could take\nyears before you get one. And I was pretty surprised, but I learned there would\nneed to be multiple clinic visits to access the program�and I'll refer you to\npage two and three of the 2019 Pump Program Annual Report that I presented\ntonight, and that's�it details the qualification process which is now in place\nin order to get an insulin pump.","index":"00872","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, in addition to those qualifications, which I would term\nbarriers, there are hidden barriers that you have to read between the lines.\nSo, completing each of the qualification steps has to be done at the clinic in\nWinnipeg, that's the clinic for all of Manitoba. They've added some virtual\noptions but the training has to be done in person at family expense, and that's\nalso burdensome when managing a chronic condition, that you would have to fly\nin from The Pas<b> </b>or anywhere if you want a pump. So, I appreciate that\nthe Peachey report prioritizes consolidating services closer to home, with\nattention to travel burdens. ","index":"00873","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, after a year�after half a year at the clinic, I learned it\nwould take us at least another year to complete all the steps, and that was as\naccelerated as we could make it. So for us, that would have meant anywhere from\neight to 12 visits with a specialist doctor and a diabetes educator, and it\ndepends on how they allow you to move through the process, and there was no\nguarantee that we'd be approved. ","index":"00874","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I'd like to point out the current Manitoba Health<b> </b>policy\nwith regards to the Pediatric Insulin Pump program. I've included that in my\nhandout as well. And the process there says only that patients have to be under\n18; that's it. DER-CA originally started with those criteria when the program\nstarted in 2012, and it's added additional criteria, adding a lot of time and\nexpense to the process. It used to be basically immediate, and now it takes\nover four years on average from the time of diagnosis to get a pump. ","index":"00875","speaker":""},{"html":"����� These added criteria�or what I would call barriers�don't conform to\nthe current Diabetes Canada clinical practice guidelines. The clinic wasn't\nable to provide me with any research evidence to support the steps they'd\nintroduced, especially a completely subjective psychosocial assessment of our\nwhole family. There's no evidence that they could provide me to show that a\npsychosocial process could predict or assist in using an insulin pump. ","index":"00876","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, patients like us worry about meeting the criteria and shifting\nsubjective goalposts, worry about the pumps that won't be renewed; we had an\nunhealthy patient-provider relationship at that clinic. To me, this all led to\na breaking point and we considered moving as a family from Manitoba to care for\nour son. Our son was miserable and he was doing worse and worse as he's very\nneedle-aversive. ","index":"00877","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I phoned the next nearest clinic, which is in Grand Forks\nhospital down in North Dakota and I asked what's the process of getting an\ninsulin pump? We'd like to get our son an insulin pump. And they said <i>[inaudible]</i>\nan appointment and see about getting him one. I was pretty shocked and I asked,\nwell, don't I need to see a specialist? What's the timeline? And they said,\nwell, send us your CGM results, and you'll see a pediatrician, a dietitian and\na diabetes educator and be on your way.� ","index":"00878","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So we drove to Grand Forks for two days of back-to-back appointments.\nOur son had his new insulin pump in two days, all conforming to the American\nDiabetes Association practice guidelines.���� ","index":"00879","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, I'd like to mention their reaction in Grand Forks on hearing\nwhat was happening in Manitoba. They said if they provided care like we do in\nManitoba, they would lose their American Diabetes Association accreditation.\nDiabetes Canada has clinical practice guidelines and they say they're\nsuggestions and they don't offer an accreditation. ","index":"00880","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, in Grand Forks they said their goal was to have young patients\nequipped with a CGM and an insulin pump on diagnosis before they left the\nhospital. Now, I'm a firm believer in public health, but I appreciated that\nGrand Forks clinic prioritized efficiency and quality to save me money and\nprovide value. I'm lucky I can afford it. But what they're doing costs a\nfraction of what our insulin pump program costs the public for us here. ","index":"00881","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We don't have to look to the US, and we probably shouldn't, but we\ncan also look to Ontario. They formed local dietitian and diabetes educator.\nThere are 83 such teams all over Ontario so that in communities as small as\n5,000 people, people can get care in their community. Those teams have access\nto a specialist endocrinologist if required, but those teams are definitely not\noperating at top of licence as they provide care in the community.","index":"00882","speaker":""},{"html":"����� It's firmly within�I sincerely appreciate the gesture of raising\nthe age of the current program to age 25, but I would like to be frank. It's a\nprogram operating independently of oversight in that the pediatric pump program\nwas due to be reviewed in 2015, but, to my knowledge, it hasn't. The previous\nannual reports indicated that patient consultation would occur, but, to my\nknowledge, there hasn't been any patient input into any of these additional\nqualifications or barriers that the clinic has added. ","index":"00883","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, in the nine years since the insulin pump program was\nintroduced, they've added many years and billable hours to the process. And\nneither is the process operating to its original stated capacity. They said\nthey anticipated a 30 per cent uptake, but they've never had people up past 20\nper cent of people in the program. They only serve 105 pump patients, and after\nexpansion that you've announced, that might only come to 150, which would indicate\nthat only 2&nbsp;per cent of the type 1 patients in Manitoba would get a pump\nthrough the program. So I don't see it as an accessible or an effective\nprogram.","index":"00884","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The overall blood glucose levels of patients at the clinic are high\nenough that complications are guaranteed. And when we voiced our concerns about\nthat in saying that's why we want a pump, we were told by a provider there,\ndon't worry; those complications could be 20 years down the road. I can't look\nat my nine-year-old, think of him as a 29-year-old with kidney failure and not\nworry. The clinic doesn't see patients past 18, and I felt they didn't see far\nenough down the road. And I don't think expanding that clinic's reach to see\npatients to age 25 is a good solution.","index":"00885","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Bill 10 talks about developing clinical and preventive service\nplans. My use of a CGM and an insulin pump are all about using the best\nclinical advice and preventing emergencies every day. That's not an\noverstatement.","index":"00886","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I would welcome Bill 10 if it would finally bring some oversight\nto the clinic that runs the insulin pump program.

We choose good foods from the\nglycemic index. I got accommodation from my work for the last three years to go\ndown to his school and daycare to give insulin injections.

Stanley <i>[phonetic]</i> has co-diagnoses of\nautism and ADHD, so for him, one of the factors that he deals with that is very\nsignificant for him is excitement. An example of how this plays out is for his\nfifth birthday we got him a pi�ata and he was so excited about it that every\ntime he talked about it, his sugars would just, like, go through the roof and,\nlike, stay there.

It's a bit high, but it's normal. And for the first time\never, we were able to see, like, a target range, and it wasn't next to the\nwords increased risk for long-term health complications.

It might be because he\nhas low proprioceptive awareness due to his autism, but he'll say he feels fine\nand the CGM is telling us that his blood sugar is 2.0, which is very, very\ndangerous, and it can be very surreal to be talking to him and he says he's\nfine when you know that his body is starting to shut down. It's only the data\nfrom the CGM that has alerted me to many similar lows that, without treating\nthem, we would have had to call an ambulance or administered glucagon, which is\na rescue drug that shocks the body into releasing sugar into the system from\nthe liver.","index":"01034","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nI'm so grateful that we have access to the CGM and the pump. They have\nincreased our quality of life in a way that I can't measure, and the things\nthat many people take for granted. Like, now, he can eat when he wants to eat\nand stop eating when he's full, and change his mind and have seconds. He got to\neat some ice cream today. I can send him to school and know that the teacher\nwill be alerted if he's heading towards an emergency situation. ","index":"01035","speaker":""},{"html":"And I can correct his high blood sugars without having to worry about\nhow many meals he's gotten that day, and how he's going to associate that with\nthe food that he's eating, and his overall long-term psychological health. ","index":"01036","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I can\nmonitor him appropriately at home when he is sick in a way that I couldn't\nwithout the tools. And I have hope that this better control will mean that he's\nnot dealing with neuropathy or eye damage when he's my age, like other type 1s\nthat I know in my peer group. ","index":"01037","speaker":""},{"html":"����� All of\nthe data from the CGM that is collected from the insulin levels that he's\ngetting, the carbs that he's eating, his blood sugar trends, we share that all\nwith Stanley's <i>[phonetic]</i> doctors and nurses through the online platform\nthat's associated with it. And it's been very valuable during the virtual\nmedical appointments, but also during troubleshooting with the clinic. When\nStanley <i>[phonetic]</i> is sick we don't have to bring him in, we can just\nupload it and call them and say have a look. ","index":"01038","speaker":""},{"html":"Other apps can be used to call a parent or a friend when his blood sugar\ndrops to dangerous levels, so somebody can do a wellness check.

I am a single mother living in the low-income\nneighborhood, and the monthly cost of Stanley's <i>[phonetic]</i> diabetes\nsupplies is more than my mortgage payments. But these tools keep the risk of\nhim developing long-term complications lower and they help us avoid emer�gency\nsituations now. So, for us, it's worth it. ","index":"01041","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Every\ntime we avoid a DKA situation when he has the flu, the health-care system will\nsave the approximately $7,000 it would have spent if he went to the hospital.\nKeeping his organs healthy now will mean that he won't have to rely on\ngovernment-funded programs, like dialysis in the future, and his body stays\nhealthy. His chances of getting a job that will afford him the private health\nbenefits that he needs will help him access the tools he needs to live longer. ","index":"01042","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So it\nfeels great to see equitable health being written into this bill, but it must\nmean that coverage of medical needs would not have an age discrimination built\nin. It feels good to be able to tell Stanley <i>[phonetic]</i> that policy\nmakers are discussing this disease and they want to help where they can. But\nwhen he asks me why it stops when it turns 25, I don't have a good answer to\nthat question. ","index":"01043","speaker":""},{"html":"So this year marks the 100th year since insulin was discovered in\nCanada, and before getting it that�before that getting a T-1 diagnosis was a\ndeath sentence.
