Hence, a vision for the province is to\nprovide a vote-anywhere service to all eligible voters on election day, similar\nto advance voting. ","index":"00064","speaker":""},{"html":"����� To get\nto that, there are a few steps involved. Step&nbsp;&nbsp;1 was to introduce\nmodifications during advance voting, which was successfully implemen�ted during\nthe 2019 general election. Step 2 is what we are proposing today: to vote at\nany polling place in your electoral division and at any poll. This will improve\nservice for voters and increase efficiency while allowing us to introduce an\nonline portal for political participants for the 43rd general election. If&nbsp;&nbsp;this\nis successful, then we will propose vote anywhere in the province on election\nday for the 44th &nbsp;general election.","index":"00065","speaker":""},{"html":"That's the vision for this. And here are the steps as we see it through\nthis illustration. A voter is greeted by a voting official. With the use of\ntechnology, we can adopt a first-come, first-served model for serving voters,\nand the voter will be directed to any open poll. The election official will\nverify the ID, strike the voter off the electronic list and provide a ballot.\nThe voter will mark the ballot behind the security screen and then proceed to\nthe tabulator where the ballot will be fed. This will complete the voting\nprocess. ","index":"00066","speaker":""},{"html":"Not only does the system provide greater con�venience for voters, it\nreduces the waiting time, and it also requires less staff than that existing\nmodel.","index":"00067","speaker":""},{"html":"����� A key\nbenefit of this model for parties would be access to a secure party information\nportal. Parties would access regularly updated lists of who has voted from\ntheir desktop without the need for bingo sheets. Updates would be available\nhourly during advance and on election day.","index":"00068","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We\nhave included some mock-ups of the portal, what it would look like. The first\nis a dashboard. This&nbsp;&nbsp;shows a snapshot of voting activity around the\nprovince, including activity broken out by time intervals.","index":"00069","speaker":""},{"html":"����� On the\nnext screen you will see an elector search. Elector searches can be done by the\nvoter's first name, last name, address or even by street. ","index":"00070","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nlast screenshot shows you the download page that provides access to a current\nlist of voters who have cast their ballot. Parties would be able access this\ninformation for any electoral division in which they have a candidate running. ","index":"00071","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nuse of tabulators is critical to this process. It will increase efficiency\nthrough automated counting of ballots, but most importantly, it will allow us\nreporting results by polls.","index":"00072","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We\nwill continue to use paper ballots. The ballots would be retained and available\nif a recount is necessary. Tabulators would be independent units and not\nconnected to the Internet, and we will have multiple security measures in place\nto protect the privacy of voters and to ensure integrity of the process.�� ","index":"00073","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Tabulators\nused on election day can also be used during advance voting, particularly at\nhigh-traffic polls. At advance polls, we would use certified printers to print\nballots on demand for non-resident voters. Those are voters who vote outside\ntheir home electoral division. ","index":"00074","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In our\ncurrent model, these voters receive write-in ballots and a list of candidates\nfor an electoral division. Printing ballots on demand will enhance efficiency\nand reduce the physical movement of ballots.","index":"00075","speaker":""},{"html":"����� After\na detailed analysis of voting places and voter turnout in the past two general\nelections, we are projecting that on election day technology will enable us to\nuse this at approximately 77 per cent of polling places with a coverage of 95\nper cent of voters being served this way. ","index":"00076","speaker":""},{"html":"����� For advance\nvoting, we estimate approximately 98 per cent of resident and 94 per cent of\nnon-resident voters would be served using electronic strike-off and tabulators.\n","index":"00077","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We\nbelieve that this proposal meets the criteria of section 28.1 as follows.\nFirst, it improves the voting process for voters through increased convenience\nand shorter wait times. Second, it achieves administrative efficiency as\nprocesses at the polls are streamlined. Parties will receive regularly, hourly\nvoting infor�mation, count is completed more quickly, and finally, this model\npreserves the integrity of the vote as voters are still required to show ID,\nballots are still cast by hand, secrecy is preserved and paper ballots are\npreserved in the case of a recount. ","index":"00078","speaker":""},{"html":"����� If\nthis proposal is approved, we will need a year to 18 months for full testing\nand implementation. Hence, timing is critical. This will include frequent\ncontacts with political participants to ensure this works well in the next\nelection.","index":"00079","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We\nwill be happy to return to the committee next year to update our progress and\ndemonstrate the process. Hence, we are recommending that Elections Manitoba\nproceeds with vote-anywhere-within-your-electoral-division model for the next\ngeneral election or in any upcoming by-election. This will include\nconsequential amendments to adapt advance voting to allow for the use of\ntabulators and certify printers for ballots on demand for non-resident voters.\nThe cost for this, we are projecting it to be in the range of 1&nbsp;to&nbsp;1.3\nmillion.� ","index":"00080","speaker":""},{"html":"����� When\nwe had started the Manitoba Voter Register project, we had estimated $3.8\nmillion for the four-year cycle. The actual cost is coming to $2.5 million, so\nthe saving of $1.3 million can be used for this proposal. ","index":"00081","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Moving\non to the other recommendations in that annual report, the first one is\ntelephone voting. ","index":"00082","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(15:20)","index":"00083","speaker":""},{"html":"����� This\nwould provide an alternative to the mail-in ballot process used for absentee\nvoting, which could be especially valuable for members of the Armed Forces and\noversees travellers for whom it can be difficult to return the mail-in ballot\nby election day. ","index":"00084","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We did\nconsult with the Canadian Armed Forces, who were supportive of telephone voting\nas a way to ensure the members could participate in elections, even when posted\nin some very remote parts of the world. They appreciated the legislative\nprocess that would unfold, but definitely saw the benefit of telephone voting.\nThe ability to vote by phone would allow absentee voters and people with\ndisabilities to quickly and easily cast their ballot with appropriate security\nmeasures. ","index":"00085","speaker":""},{"html":"����� For\nreference, the number of absentee voters in the last election was 668 and homebound\nwere 649. So this is a very small population that we are looking at for the\ntelephone voting option. ","index":"00086","speaker":""},{"html":"����� There\nare three other recommendations on voters lists. The first is to standardize\nthe content of the&nbsp;voters list each time it is provided to political\nparticipants at all phases of election and on an annual basis. The second is\ncandidates receive the prelimi�nary and revised voters list only upon request.\nThe third recommendation would allow returning officers to include updates and\ncorrections on the final voters list. ","index":"00087","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We are\nalso recommending that the leave provision be extended to returning office\nstaff and interpreters so that they can support registration activity. ","index":"00088","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Finally,\nwe are recommending that electronic signatures be accepted for filing of forms\nunder The Elections Act and under The Election Financing Act.","index":"00089","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We\nhave two other recommendations, new ones, under The Election Financing Act.\nThey relate to constituency associations. The first would change the deadline\nfor filing by constituency associations from January 31st to March 31st. This\nwould make the timing for the deadline consistent with that of registered\nparties, allowing financial officers to file more accurate information. ","index":"00090","speaker":""},{"html":"����� A\nconsequential amendment from this change would be to change the date that the\nlate filing fee would come into effect to align with the later filing deadline.\n","index":"00091","speaker":""},{"html":"����� There\nare two carried-forward recommendations. The first is to reimburse 100 per cent\nof all reasonable disability and child-care expenses to all candidates who are\nnot�not only those who get the 5 per cent of valid votes, to enhance\naccessibility; and the second is to include a time period for recovery of late\nfiling fees, also under The Election Financing Act. ","index":"00092","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Another\nrecommendation is to establish a single address authority for Manitoba.\nConsistency in addressing, including street name and address format, allow for\nvalidation and matching necessary to assign a voter to an electoral division\nand polling place. It also impacts the accuracy of voter information provided\nto candidates and parties. A single address authority would improve efficiency,\nnot just for electoral purposes, but also for public safety, such as fire,\nambulance and police services could use standardized addresses.

It was used in the by‑election in�St. Boniface by-election\nbefore that. The Manitoba Voter Register was created using the 2016 general\nelection final voters list and also regular updates from data sources primarily\nfrom Elections Canada, MPI, Vital Statistics and Manitoba Health. ","index":"00098","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In a\nset-date election, the plan was to include a&nbsp;&nbsp;registration drive 30\ndays before the election period would commence. In the unplanned election, the\n30‑day dedicated registration drive was impossible, but we did do\nmail-outs in April, which boosted the registration activity and also we had\ntarget registration as part of the election calendar. ","index":"00099","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The�post-election,\nwe did a survey on the voter list quality. The voter list quality indicated 95\nper cent for accuracy. There was a significant increase from&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;completeness\nperspective. It increased from 85 per cent to 91 per cent. However, the\ncurrency of the list did show a decline to 85 per cent, which is not\nunexpected, because the register, in case of an enumeration when you're going\ndoor to door, it is very current, when�but when you are relying on third-party\ndata sources, there could be a time gap when the information is updated and\nwhen it is included in our database. ","index":"00100","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In a\ntypical year, we have three to four data cycle updates which happen. So this\nannual list, which is going to be provided to the parties in February, will have\nthe last update from December.

And one is from\naddresses, which comes from municipalities, which is City of Winnipeg, Brandon,\nSelkirk, Thompson and municipal affairs department. Both these lists have�or,\nboth these data sources have to be aligned in order to update the Manitoba\nVoter Register.

Can you explain exactly what that would mean,\nhow that would manifest itself and what it would look like?

There is a civic-style\naddress, which is in Winnipeg, like, 500 Main Street. But as we go into rural\nareas, there could be different styles of addresses which are used. ","index":"00104","speaker":""},{"html":"����� There is a lot-block-plan; there is section-township‑range;\nthere is a free-range address, which would be the house next to the big rock,\nor the house with the red roof; and there are 911 addressing, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even\nthough association of municipalities has recommended standardization of\naddresses, each municipality can adopt their own addressing stan�dards. That's\none aspect to it. ","index":"00105","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The other is, as a consumer, if I�or, as a citizen, if I go to MPI,\nI can give my address as section, township, range. In Manitoba Health, I can\nprovide the same address as a 911 address or a civic-style address. So when\ninformation comes to me, comes to&nbsp;&nbsp;Elections Manitoba, I can have Joe\nDoe having two&nbsp;different styles of addresses. ","index":"00106","speaker":""},{"html":"����� For us to ensure that they are the same voter, we either have their\ndate of birth, which would be the unique identifier, and the gender, which\nhelps us in data matching. But if these�this information is not there, then\nthere could be a possibility of having two separate records for the same\nperson. ","index":"00107","speaker":""},{"html":"����� It also impacts the geocoding, because a section-township-range can\nbe geocoded, but not to the precise point, because in a section-township-range\nthere could be four points. It's a quarter. So there could be four points to\nit, while a civic-style address allows for better geocoding. A lot-block-plan,\nas 911, again, there are certain assumptions when it comes. So, when we are\ndoing mapping�providing maps to our election workers or providing maps to the\nparties, we are making assumptions as to the address points as to where they\nare. ","index":"00108","speaker":""},{"html":"����� That's a bit of a background to why a single address authority\nwould be recommended. That means the vision would be something similar to, say,\nNova Scotia, where they have one department. If a new lot is identified, then\none department provides the address, and that's the address which can be\nused�or, which can be used by other government departments and any other agency\nwhich is using. So if I go to Manitoba Health, I can only use that particular\nstyle of address. ","index":"00109","speaker":""},{"html":"����� This\nalso helps when we are saying, for geo�coding purposes, for emergency service\npersonnel to know exactly where to go.
