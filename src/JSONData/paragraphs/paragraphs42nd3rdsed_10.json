I cannot tell you how many times a new matter,\nusually a small claims court action, came across my desk, and after reviewing\nit I thought to myself, there has to be a better way. ","index":"00048","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nclaims resolution mechanism, which this bill creates, will, I believe, be that\nbetter way. I'm confident that, with the broad parameters set by the bill, a\nregulation can be crafted which will enable the covered claims to be resolved\nfairly and efficiently. Both of these elements�fairness and efficiency�are critical.\nFairness includes both the independence of the decision-makers, which is built\ninto the system, and equity as between the insurer, MPI, and the insured. ","index":"00049","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Claimant\nhas a right to receive the full amount to which they are entitled by law�no\nless and no more. And MPI, on behalf of its ratepayers, should not ever be\ncompelled to pay more than a claim is reasonably, objectively and legally\nworth. The vast majority of what I will call tin-and-glass claims�that is,\nphysical damage to insured motor vehicles�are resolved within a month or two\nand to the complete satisfaction of the customer. Far too many of the others\nremain open for a year or more and involve far more acrimony than one would\nexpect from what is essentially a property damage claim. These situations are\nstressful for the customer and stressful for MPI staff. ","index":"00050","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\none amendment I would recommend in�volves section 4 of the bill, section 67.3\nof the MPIC act. The problem here is with the last three provisions. These\nprovisions carve out a limited right to commence a court proceeding with\nrespect to liability assessments made by MPI. I understand these provi�sions\nwere added by the regulatory affairs committee because some members felt\nuncomfortable about taking away a claimant's right to their day in court. ","index":"00051","speaker":""},{"html":"����� This\nis a bad idea for two reasons. First, one's, quote, day in court is not all\nit's cracked up to be and it often goes badly for the claimant. More on this\npoint in a moment. And second, there's a compelling precedent for replacing\ncourt-based course�court actions with an administrative dispute resolution\nprocess. I am referring, of course, to part 2 of the MPIC act that came into\nforce on March 1st, 1994. Commonly referred to as the personal injury\nprotection plan, or simply no-fault, it represented a seismic shift in how\npeople injured in motor vehicle accidents involving Manitoba drivers and\nvehicles were compensated for their injuries and their consequential financial\nlosses. ","index":"00052","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Sections\nseventy-two and -three were the game changers.

","index":"00053","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Almost\n30 years later, Manitoba remains the only common law province with the pure\nno-fault system of bodily injury compensation. Having worked under both\nsystems, tort and no-fault, I can honestly say that each has its strong points\nand its shortcomings, but one thing is certain: Manitobans have been largely\ninsulated from the double-digit annual increases in insurance rates in\njurisdictions which continue to operate under a sole tort system of bodily\ninjury compensation.

","index":"00056","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Let me\ngive you one all-too-common example of what a day in court looks like for some\npeople. It is one of those types of cases which would be captured by subsection\n67.3(1)(a) of the bill, single-vehicle accident. The Highway Traffic Act\ncreates an expec�tation that a driver will maintain proper control of their\nvehicle at all times. There are a myriad of situations in which control may be\nlost, resulting in a single-vehicle accident. The driver in those cases has the\nburden of rebutting what is essentially a statutory presumption of fault. ","index":"00057","speaker":""},{"html":"����� While\nthe bar is high, the driver in those situations is very likely to be held 100\nper cent at fault. MPI can and does recognize such extenuating circumstances: a\nwild or domestic animal unexpectedly appearing on the roadway, forcing the\ndriver to take emergency evasive action; a sudden change in weather that reduces\nvisibility to zero in a matter of seconds; a dramatic downpour, an intense hail\nstorm, an abrupt whiteout. Any one of these circumstances might lead MPI to\nexcuse the driver for an ensuing collision. And even today, in the case of a\nlegitimate difference of opinion regarding liability for a single-vehicle acci�dent\nwhere MPI has assessed the driver fully at fault, there are few options open to\nsomeone wishing to contest that assessment.","index":"00058","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nRates Appeal Board can soften the financial impact of an at-fault accident, but\nit has no jurisdiction to alter the underlying liability finding. The Licence\nSuspension Appeal Board can grant limited driving privileges if the incident\nturns out to be the tipping point that leads to a licence suspension but,\nagain, it has no jurisdiction to change the liability finding. And while many\npeople continue to try it every year, the small-claims court has no\njurisdiction to issue a declaratory judgment�a declaration is an equitable\nremedy that only a judge can make. ","index":"00059","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Typically,\nan unhappy claimant will attend a court office to initiate a small claim.\nSomebody there will tell them erroneously that they need to sue MPI for their\ndeductible. Such an action is doomed to fail before the ink on the paper has\neven dried. There are several reasons for this.","index":"00060","speaker":""},{"html":"����� First,\nand contrary to popular belief, deductible is neither a penalty nor a fine. It\nis by definition the portion of your loss which is not covered by your\ninsurance policy. The obligation of your insurer, whether home or auto, private\nor public, starts with your deductible plus $1. You are essentially\nself-insured for the rest. This concept is embodied in sub�section 51(1) of the\nAutomobile Insurance Coverage Regulation. In any event, unless you're\nunemployed, retired or work nights, you have already taken at least half a day\noff work to file your claim and serve a copy on MPI. The hearing date assigned\nby the court will likely be several months away. In the meantime, you will\nreceive a copy of a court filing made by MPI which cites subsection 51(1) and\nadvises you that MPI has no obligation to reimburse your deductible. ","index":"00061","speaker":""},{"html":"����� When\nyour date comes up, you will again take time off work to attend court and you\nwill find your matter on lengthy court docket typically listing about 30 cases\nof various kinds. If you have been fortunate enough to find a parking spot and\nyou have further lucked out because there are enough hearing officers available\nthat day to deal with all of the dockets, you will find that someone from\nMPI�usually an articling student or a junior lawyer�is there to advise the\ncourt that the matter is being contested. Something you will already know from\nthe court filing in the cover letter that it came with. ","index":"00062","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nhearing officer will adjourn the matter to a fixed date in time�again, several\nmonths away�when the matter will be heard on its merits. Again, you will need\nto take time off work and again you will be fortunate if an unanticipated staff\nshortage has not necessitated a further adjournment. You will make your\nargument, MPI will respond and you will lose because you have sued MPI for a\nsum it never had any obligation to pay you and for a remedy which the\nsmall-claims court never had any jurisdiction to grant you. ","index":"00063","speaker":""},{"html":"����� You\nwill leave justifiably angry and frustrated, to say nothing of a tad poorer\nbecause in addition to your own filing fee, lost wages and parking costs, you\nwill also owe MPI about $150 for court costs, your driving record will still\nshow an at-fault accident from which a number of financial and other consequences\nmay flow, and your dispute with MPI�regardless of how meritorious you believe\nit to be�will remain unre�solved. Was it worth it to have your day in court?\nMost people who have been through the experience would answer with a resounding\nno. ","index":"00064","speaker":""},{"html":"����� To sum\nup, this bill is a positive step towards ensuring that MPI claimants have\naccess to an independent, fair and expeditious dispute resolution mechanism. <i>[inaudible]</i>\nlong as the adjudicators are properly qualified and the statutory timelines are\nclosely adhered to, MPI ratepayers can expect to receive prompt, evidence-based\nand legally sound decisions with respect to their claims. ","index":"00065","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Not\neverybody will be happy with their result, but what they will have is closure\nand the ability to move on with their lives. The certainty and finality of even\na bad result is so much better than the ongoing uncertainty of a stressful\nsituation which has no end in sight. Claim dispute tribunal will give people\nthat certainty and that finality. But please, don't give them the false hope of\na Hollywood end to their, quote, day in court. Not happening now, and it won't\nhappen under this bill. ","index":"00066","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Thank\nyou for your attention.

The arbitration system ensures that decision-makers will be\nknowledgeable <i>[inaudible]</i> car industry, other�wise they wouldn't be\nappointed as arbitrators.

Bill 15 very oddly creates its almost own\nlittle walled <i>[inaudible]</i> quasi‑judicial dispositions, and there's\njust no need for that. </span>","index":"00107","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� The third problem: Bill 15 rules out in-person hearings. And I\nthink that was the point that the committee member, Mr. Sandhu, was trying to\nget at when he raised it. And Mr. Scaletta didn't answer that, by the way.

","index":"00223","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now, I\nwant to say that, in reading the now-repealed balanced 'budgeck' act, one thing\nI noticed immediately is that the language and calculations that are used are\nfar more straightforward and compre�hensible for someone like me, a private\ncitizen who is&nbsp;&nbsp;simply trying to understand if and how the government\nis being accountable. While the now-repealed balanced budget act offers a\nfairly simple formula for salary reductions, The Fiscal Respon�sibility and\nTaxpayer Protection Act that was passed in the Second Session of the 41st\nLegislature is far more complicated, and I am frustrated to see that this new\ncalculation proposed in Bill 48 is even more convoluted and difficult to\ndiscern.

In this formula, A is the amount withheld for\nthat year under subsection (2). So I need to understand subsection (2). That is\n20 per cent of ministerial salary to be withheld or 40 per cent after\nconsecutive contravenings of deficit, noting that in section 8(7), this does\nnot apply to a person for the year that they become a minister. ","index":"00226","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nnow, I need to understand how much are ministers paid. Well, I've learned that\nMLA salaries in&nbsp;Manitoba are $97,753 and that Cabinet ministers have an\nadditional salary of $53,519, for a total of $151,272. Now, I want to take a\nmoment here to note that when I looked at the average industrial salary in\nManitoba�or, sorry, the average industrial wage in Manitoba, that is $49,598.12,\nwhich is three times less than the salary of a Cabinet minister in Manitoba. I\nthink that's important to note. ","index":"00227","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Back\nto the formula. So let's say that 20 per cent of the salary of a minister is\nwithheld. That is $30,254.40.

I couldn't find that number, but I\ncould find the projected deficit, which I understand is somewhere in the\nvicinity of $1,597,000,000. So one eighth would be, I understand, $199,625,000.","index":"00228","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, C is\nwhere things got tricky for me. If I could understand it correctly, it\nbasically is suggesting that if the government does not increase the deficit by\nmore than $200 million, then the ministers do not need to receive a salary\nreduction. So, if I understand correctly, the reduction is $30,000�sorry,\n$30,254.40 times $199,625,000 minus, I guess, $1,999,625,000 divided by\n$199,000�sorry, $199,625,000, which equals zero. So I'm really confused, and\nperhaps I misunderstood it, but if I have misunderstood it, I think that part\nof the blame clearly lies with a government that cannot make a clear commitment\nto accountability and to the ministers understanding their clear privilege and\nsetting out a clear wage reduction.
