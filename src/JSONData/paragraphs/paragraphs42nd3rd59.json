And there have been some very strong arguments made both by residents\nof Glenwood and St. Vital as well as residents of St. Boniface. And the example\nI�there's a�in St. Vital, one of the�one of the impacts has been because these\nare all�you have a hundred one-off developments�is that nobody is paying\nattention to the overall impact on things like water flows or�and environmental\nimpacts. And one of the consequences of this is that, especially for these\nolder neighbourhoods, it means that the combined sewer system is being\noverwhelmed because the usual overall infrastructure changes that would\nnormally be made or would normally be taken into consideration on a\nbroader�when an entire subdivision or an entire development was being planned\naren't being done.","index":"00845","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So it\nmeans that we have dozens and dozens of new houses going in in ways that affect\nexisting infra�structure, but the existing infrastructure is not being\naddressed.

So effectively, it created a very unfair and asymmetrical system\nrecognizing that developers can and have been&nbsp; frustrated by various\nmeasures of the City of Winnipeg and elsewhere.

People still\nwanted to be able to have their say because, ultimately, when you add up the\ncumulative wealth of all the people who own houses around a given development,\nit will almost always�it will always exceed that of the development�the new\ndevelopment in question, especially if it's an infill or a�something that's\nbeing developed in an older community.","index":"00848","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So you\nmight have�you want to make sure that you have a situation where a community\nthat might have $500 million worth of property that they own together are not\nshut out and silenced when another developer wants to come in�with a single\ndeveloper wants to come in with a project that might be worth 8&nbsp;or 5\nmillion dollars. They might be very fine projects, but we have to recognize\nboth the essential right of people to have a say in how their community is run\nand what it looks like and, you know, that grassroots level democracy is\nabsolutely critical.

In this case, you had\ndevelopers; you had municipalities; you had demo�cracy proponents; you had\nmembers of the public; you had folks from all different stripes; you had the\nmayor of Winnipeg, for goodness' sake, come to committee to present, to say\nthat this was a bad bill in so many ways. They talked about the lack of\ndemocracy. They talked about the lack of choice. They talked about the lack of\na plan on behalf of this government, how the entire purpose of this\nlegislation, coupled with the�their other piece of legislation, Bill 38, was\ndesigned to be confrontational, was designed to be political and politicized\nright from the beginning.","index":"00981","speaker":""},{"html":"����� This\nisn't a government that's looking to move us forward into the future of the\nmetropolitan region and a future where municipalities can work together to get infrastructure\nbuilt. Hey, that's a novel idea; that's a great idea, Mr. Deputy Speaker,\nsomething we would support, as we did in the Keystone development proposal and\nbill that came forward last fall.

A government that claims to be against\nred tape brings in a piece of legislation that adds a complex, you know,\n'nother' layer of red tape and bureaucracy and then designs it in a way that\nthere's a clear bottleneck to that process where, you know, members from, as I&nbsp;\nsaid, municipalities where developers came and said, this will make things\nworse if you institute this bill as it's being written.","index":"00984","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We\ndon't have to look far. We can look to provinces like Ontario where we've seen\nhow the municipal board, an unelected board and a board that has no oversight\nand can be, you know, run by, you know, anybody.

They then went ahead and they walked that\nback because of the work of the opposition. However, baked into this bill right\nfrom the start and still remaining in the new Bill 37 is a requirement for\nSelkirk to be a part of this municipal metro region. <span lang=\"EN-US\">We had a\ncompelling presentation from elected officials and bureaucrats in Selkirk who\ntalked about how this plan does not fit their municipality. </span>","index":"00987","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� They are, Mr. Deputy Speaker, a hub; a hub unto\nthemselves without the City of Winnipeg. More people from the surrounding\nregions commute into Selkirk than commute out of it to go to work in places\nlike Winnipeg or the surrounding area. In fact, they bring in people from the\nInterlake, they bring in people from surrounding areas and into Eastman. They\nhave a hospital; they are a centre unto them�selves. They do not want to be a\npart of this bill. </span>","index":"00988","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� So, if this government is listening, if they want\nto try to do the right thing, once again, as we forced them to do in the\nchangeover from Bill 38 to Bill 37, here's their opportunity. They can go ahead\nand they can support this amendment and they can say: you're right, Selkirk; we\nunderstand and respect your autonomy. We�you know, maybe they want to say: we\nthink you should be a part of this metro plan�but give them the option to opt\nin or not, because as it stands right now, as I said, baked into the bill on a\nfundamental level, Selkirk is a part of this, and they are telling us very\nclearly they do not want to be a part of it.</span>","index":"00989","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� So, you know, this comes down to respect and a lack of it from\nthis government to those municipal leaders.

You know, they are telling\nus unequivocally, and they did so at committee, that they don't want to be\nincluded in this bill. </span>","index":"00990","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� It's a simple change.
