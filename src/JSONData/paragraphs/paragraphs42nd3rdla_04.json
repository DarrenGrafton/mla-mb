That actually wouldn't be the case because we have prevailing\nlegislation which protects workers' wages and it is protected right there.

There's nothing like this\nin Canada. It was privately paid for with private money, without going to any\nlevel of government to ask for any subsidy whatsoever. I would to�you to\ncompare that record with many corporate entities that invest in our provinces\nand what they seek in return. We ask for nothing. We invested in our province. ","index":"00144","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nfrom the outset, we wanted this facility not only to be a centre of excellence\nfor trades training. We wanted this facility to be connected with our\ncommunity.

These people include Sergeant Tommy Prince, a\ndecorated war hero, a room�at least one of three people who have a street named\nafter them.

Yet, here we are, insistent on passing\nlegislation that has no purpose, no value, no rhyme, no reason and certainly is\nnot a legacy worth building. Yet again, here we are.

I know how passionate you are about this,\nbut this is really about choice and that the�whether it's a unionized or\nnon-unionized business should not play into whether or not somebody can bid and\nget the contract.

For\nthe duration of the project, after a union or a non-union contractor is\nselected, they must work under the�under common terms.

It is deva�stating. ","index":"00175","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, in\nthat context, and it should be very clear that any contractor that comes under\nthe BNA and works at a Hydro project, the minute they leave, they are\nnon-union.

","index":"00191","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Bill\n13 would destabilize a method of achieving these important outcomes, project\nlabour agreements, making them, in their traditional form, illegal but also\ncreating a barrier for similar forms of labour manage�ment, as well as\nopportunity generation and recruit�ment of under-represented groups, in the\nform of community benefits agreements, which are procure�ment tools that are\nrapidly gaining popularity in many&nbsp;&nbsp;jurisdictions across Canada, both\nfederally, provincially and municipally, for their social out�comes and their\nlong-term, downstream cost savings for government services, like health and\njustice.","index":"00192","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But\nit's some important things about project labour agreements in construction\nspecifically and a lot of these have been touched on already and I'm sure will\nbe touched on and reiterated with speakers following myself.

","index":"00193","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\n(1) PLAs are critical to help workers develop their skills on the job site.\nThis is critical for training apprentices who can often then gain the\nexperience they need for each level within the duration of one or two big\nprojects. And, as Sudhir had mentioned, we have seen many Indigenous workers\nenter through work readiness programs, in advance of Keeyask, knowing that\nthere was a mandate to hire Indigenous workers.
