This is about getting rid of a tax\nsystem that's clumsy, out-of-date, and doesn't reflect today's realities.\nSo�and it's also about providing tax relief to low-income earners, to seniors,\nand it's also to business, and those that we rely on to invest in Manitoba.

And, if you stack that up on top of our�the PST reduction that we did\nand also raising the basic personal exemption, you see a number of things that\nthis government is doing to stack things up to help low-income families: to\ndealing with poverty; to make housing affordable for many people�and, again,\nmany seniors living in, you know, with fixed incomes, this gives them more\ndisposable income.

And if�again, if you're looking for steps towards reducing\npoverty, these combinations of things are all going in the right way.

It's archaic; it doesn't�it's not relevant in today's world. So\nwinding this thing down over a measured time of 10 years is sensible.

All we have to do is look here in the Chamber today, see the folks\nthat are with us, and be happy knowing that more money is going to be going\nback into their pockets, so they can expand and they can go into future\npost-secondary education if that is their choice. Maybe they're entrepreneurs,\nwant to start a business right away. Putting more money back into their pockets\nwill allow them to make that decision on their own.

The idea behind\nremoving the education tax from property tax is supposed to be a 10-year plan;\nand that's if we're feeling optimistic, Mr. Deputy Speaker. We know that this\ngovernment doesn't often do what they say they're going to do, but for them to\nbe bringing forward a resolution patting themselves on the back this early on,\nit's a little conflicting. ","index":"00266","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So let's break it down, Mr. Deputy Speaker.
