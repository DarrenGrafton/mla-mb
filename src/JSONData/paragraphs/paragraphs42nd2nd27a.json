I would just share with the House that I did receive a letter\nfrom the CEO of Manitoba Hydro, Jay Grewal, who indicated her support for this\nbill, and the rationale that was spelled out, actually, I think bears some\nattention. ","index":"00292","speaker":""},{"html":"����� What the CEO of Manitoba Hydro was spelling out is that I'm sure\nthey would support this bill in normal times, but that there is perhaps an even\nstronger impetus to support it right now, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The\nreason being that liquidity markets, given the fact that so many government are\nrushing out to try and secure credit at this time, that the liquidity markets\nare very crowded, and this is making it difficult for Manitoba Hydro to use\ntheir normal debt instruments that they would float on the market. And without\nrecalling the exact verbiage or phraseology of the letter, I believe the CEO\ndid describe how they are being forced into some rather unique and exotic\ntechniques to try and secure these loans during this difficult period. ","index":"00293","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I think we all understand that Manitoba Hydro is probably seeing a\nton of residential demand in terms of people staying home and having to use\ntheir hydro power to stream content online or to do their Zoom meetings or to\nparticipate in the teleconferences and charging their phones throughout this\nwhole period. However, there is also likely a downturn in terms of the\nindustrial users of Manitoba Hydro. There are also less manufacturers operating\nat full capacity. And, as a result, some of the revenue that Hydro typically\ncounts on has disappeared. ","index":"00294","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So with those facts in mind, it does make sense on the face of it\nthat Manitoba Hydro be allowed to have the ability to have a higher debt\nceiling with which they can currently operate under and�you know, so I would\nthank the CEO of Hydro for their willingness to engage directly with MLAs, and\nwe'll likely be following up with follow-up questions and further conversations\nwith Hydro's leadership just because it&nbsp;&nbsp;is a very important Crown\ncorporation that all Manitobans deserve to have insight into and to know that\nit is being properly stewarded. ","index":"00295","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I also want to just point out for the benefit of the Legislative\nAssembly, it is our understanding that while this change in policy with respect\nto debt at Manitoba Hydro could be accomplished through this piece of\nlegislation, perhaps it could also just be run as a matter of course. Cabinet,\nas an example, could provide an order to provide this increased borrowing\nauthority to Manitoba Hydro. However, recognizing the situation that we're in,\nwe were, you know, willing to allow this to come forward today and, of course,\nto have the opportunity to debate this bill for some time. ","index":"00296","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I put those few comments on the record with&nbsp;&nbsp;respect\nto that correspondence with Manitoba Hydro directly. And then I would further\nadd that it is&nbsp;our view that Manitoba Hydro, and now Efficiency Manitoba,\nthat all of these Crown corporations operating in this space are essential to\nus being able to fight the existential threat that is climate change while also\nstill having a role in powering the economic development of the province of\nManitoba. We all know Manitoba Hydro creates many, many good jobs, not only in\nthe construction of projects, but also for the people who maintain the lines or\nthe people who are operating the day-to-day activities of Manitoba Hydro. And\nso we want to see Manitoba Hydro to be a very strong, publicly owned\ncorporation. ","index":"00297","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so while we are willing to entertain some, perhaps,\nhousekeeping changes as this legislation contemplates, we are not willing to\nsee any of the proposed changes under other legislation, such as Bill&nbsp;&nbsp;44.\nIt's very important that Manitoba Hydro remains a public utility so that\nManitobans can have the full benefit of both the financial engine at the heart\nof Manitoba Hydro, but also of its possibility of being a dramatic tool in\nturning around the fight against climate change that we all know that we have\nto succeed on.

We will be working\nsteadfast with community organizations both in the environmental sector and\nindigenous organizations to also ensure that Manitoba Hydro reconciles itself\nwith its past impacts on First&nbsp;&nbsp;Nations and Metis and other folks in\nthe province.

When you talk about angling, the correct verb there is\ngwaashkwebijige, which means she or he angles using a rod and reel. However, if\nyou're fishing using any other technique such as a net, it's a different verb:\ngiigoonyike.
