But there's going\nto be fewer dollars linked to those accounts as a result of this. ","index":"00662","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Similarly, again, when you look at a wealthy landlord, is it fair\nthat the government is using people who might see a hundred-dollar rebate to\ntry and benefit somebody who's going to see thousands and thousands of dollars?\nPeople who don't need that money right now, right? ","index":"00663","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Folks who are well off could become more well off over the course\nof the pandemic. People who are poor, people who are working hard, people who\nare kept in poverty by the economic policy of this government could really\nstand to benefit from having a better suite of affordability options presented\nto them that could include things like, say, lower hydro rates, or maybe even\njust hydro rates that are set at a public process rather than hydro rates that\nare passed at the Cabinet table. ","index":"00664","speaker":""},{"html":"����� That's what the reasoned amendment seeks to address, is that we\nreally do need to have, you know, some reason introduced into the discussion\nhere. Could we have a government that actually works�not�maybe works with\nmunicipalities is getting too ahead of ourselves here. ","index":"00665","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Could we have a government that meets with municipalities, right,\nrespects them, talks to them, answers the phone, takes a Zoom call, you know?\nUsed to be how it worked in Manitoba. But over the last five years,\nunfortunately, we have a Premier (Mr.&nbsp; Pallister) that can't meet with\nmunicipal leaders, least of all, the mayor of Winnipeg. ","index":"00666","speaker":""},{"html":"<i>Mr. Doyle Piwniuk, Deputy Speaker, in the Chair</i> ","index":"00667","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The reason why I bring that up in the context of the reasoned\namendment is because over the course of the last five years, in the process of\nstarving municipalities of transfer payments, what the PC&nbsp;government has\ndone is forced those muni�cipalities to increase not only taxes but also\nincrease fees on people in Manitoba. ","index":"00668","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Anyone who's gone to the Brady Road Landfill after doing their\nspring cleaning knows what I'm talking about: way more expensive to do that\ntoday than it was in the past, and the reason is because cuts are being\ndownloaded from the Province to the municipal level. ","index":"00669","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And, again, Province, under the Pallister admin�istration, likes to\ndo that because they don't think Manitobans are paying attention. But\nManitobans are paying attention. One of the things that I'm sure everyone has\nrealized during the course of the pan�demic is that there's more screen time\nhappening, and as a result, more Manitobans are tuned in to provincial\npolitics. ","index":"00670","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And wouldn't you know it, as Manitobans pay more attention to their\nprovincial government, they like what they see less and less. And so that's\nbeing brought forward here under Bill 71. The situation's going to be\nexacerbated, and the reasoned amendment is designed to just try and balance the\nsituation out again. ","index":"00671","speaker":""},{"html":"����� It's clear that, you know, if you own a 300-unit apartment building,\nthere's a party for you, and it's the party on the government's side of the\nHouse; but for everyone else in Manitoba, there's a party for you, and it's on\nthis side of the House. ","index":"00672","speaker":""},{"html":"����� It's clear for people in Manitoba that if you're a renter, there's\none party that's going to ignore you, and it's the party on that side of the\nHouse, not�ignore is too soft. There's a party that's going to actively make\nthings worse for you, and it's on that side of the House.","index":"00673","speaker":""},{"html":"����� If you're a renter in Manitoba, there's a party that's got your\nback, and it's on this side of the House. And it's not just with the reasoned\namendment. It goes to the work that we've been doing to oppose above-guideline\nrent increases, and it continues right on through a whole suite of policy\nproposals that we have that's going to make life just a little bit better, to\nmake opportunity come just a little bit closer to people right across this\ngreat province. ","index":"00674","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I think I made the point in terms of the necessity of this\nreasoned amendment. I would just hope that reason still has the capacity to be\nabsorbed by the PC members, and not even all the PC members, just enough to\nensure that the reasoned amendment passes. ","index":"00675","speaker":""},{"html":"����� If you see all the vote go along party lines, Mr.&nbsp; Deputy\nSpeaker, you will know that all the PC&nbsp;MLAs have abandoned their duty to\ntheir constituents because how else would anyone vote against making life more\naffordable for renters and making the overall distribution of the promotional\nnovelty cheques that the Premier is sending out more equitable to all people in\nManitoba? ","index":"00676","speaker":""},{"html":"����� How could a suburban MLA from Winnipeg, whether that's southeast\nWinnipeg, southwest Winnipeg, northwest Winnipeg, et cetera, how could they\ndecide to not have the renters in their con�stituency made better off by this reasoned\namend�ment? ","index":"00677","speaker":""},{"html":"����� How could those same MLAs not want to tilt the balance away from\nthose homeowners in their con�stitu�encies whose homes maybe are worth\n$200,000, $300,000? How would you not want to tilt the balance away from the\nmulti-millionaires towards those folks? ","index":"00678","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Seems pretty apparent to me that not only is that the right thing\nto do in terms of the economy, having an equitable economic recovery that\nensures that the benefits of government initiatives are going to meet the needs\nof those who need it most? But it seems like it would also be smart politics as\nwell, right? ","index":"00679","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so the whole idea of just going along with the party line, I\nguess it makes sense in good times, but when you see the disaster that's\nunfolding under the PC mismanagement right now, you would think that some\npeople are going to stand up and say, you know what, I'm going to get off the\nsinking ship and I'm just going to do what the people of Manitoba sent me to\ndo, which is to give voice to their concerns and stand up for the right thing.","index":"00680","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I\nthink that's about as apparent and plain as I&nbsp; can make it. So with those\nfew words on the record, I'd say let's pass this reasoned amendment and then\nlet's just get on with the business of making Manitoba work for all of us.
