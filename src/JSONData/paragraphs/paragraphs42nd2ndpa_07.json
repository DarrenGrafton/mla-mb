","index":"00095","speaker":"Lisa Naylor"},{"html":"����� The�in\nMarch 2018, the minister released the Criminal Justice System Modernization\nStrategy, which you certainly alluded to in your opening notes. Could you\nprovide a broader overview of how implementing the new strategy and initiatives\noutlined within that is going? Kind of what's been done, what's been ongoing,\nand what's outstanding? ","index":"00096","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Mr. Wright:</b> I'd be pleased to, and I could talk all day, as you'd\nimagine. And I�so I won't. But I'm going to focus on a few that are�a few items\nI think are very relevant to the report. And I'll just focus on the�on some of\nthose initiatives, for example. ","index":"00097","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The Responsible Reintegration Initiative is an initiative that we\nestablished in 2017 that dealt with a process for supporting the reintegration,\nsometimes on early�usually on relatively short periods of early leave�temporary\nabsences to facilitate and better prepare offenders for return to the\ncommunity, successful integration. ","index":"00098","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Since that time, we started in Winnipeg, we've expanded that\nprogram to western Manitoba, refocused it to include focus on female offenders\nwith or without the temporary absence. And now we're in the process of\npreparing to tweak the program, I'd say, to more emphasize support for employment.\n","index":"00099","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And the�I can tell you that, to date, under that program we've had\n362 approved applications for offenders to work through the program; 303 of\nthose were successfully completed. A number were�small�a relatively small\nnumber, I'd say, were revoked, and not all completely successful, of course.\nAnd relatively few have returned to custody. ","index":"00100","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I would say, we're just coming up to the two years where we'll\nbe able to measure recidivism, but certainly, anecdotally, we're�that program\nhas been very successful. And I think one of the rather anecdotal�but measures\nof that success is that we're finding that individuals who are in the program,\nonce they complete their sentences and no longer <span lang=\"EN-US\">have any&nbsp;&nbsp;formal\nobligation, are maintaining contact with their worker in that program's\nprobation officer, community corrections worker, beyond the period of their\nsentence.

The\nRCMP has been a very big proponent but also helps�health�regional health\nauthorities, schools and others. So that's another feature, I'd say, that we're\nquite pleased, very pleased with. </span>","index":"00104","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� Restorative\njustice is a central element of the�our strategy. We established the\nRestorative Justice Centre in Winnipeg in 2017, and that was very helpful in\nexpanding the number and, frankly, making restorative justice more easily\naccessible for prosecutors and police. We work with the Winnipeg Police\nmediation services.
