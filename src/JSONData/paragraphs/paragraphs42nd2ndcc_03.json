That is true today, and we very\nmuch believe that that role will only increase in prominence as we move into\nthe future. ","index":"00042","speaker":""},{"html":"����� There are many asks of public leaders at this time,&nbsp;&nbsp;but\nif I might hazard to summarize them, it is that we find a way to continue\ngrowing an advanced economy in this province while decarbonizing and reducing\ngreenhouse gas emissions. Thought of in another way; that we meet the challenge\nof climate change at the same time that we continue providing economic growth\nand job opportunities and economic development for people here in Manitoba. And\ncertainly, Manitoba Hydro is well-poised to help us deliver on those twin and\nunseparable goals.","index":"00043","speaker":""},{"html":"����� At the same time, I'm also very mindful that Manitoba Hydro has\nunfinished business in the form of reconciling its impact on the human cost\nborne by Manitoba First Nations, particularly in the North but not exclusively.\nMany Interlake First Nations have also been affected by Manitoba Hydro and\ntheir management of water resources in the province.","index":"00044","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so, at this time in our nation's history and in our province's\nhistory, you know, we have a really unique opportunity in which we could\nundertake to create jobs for subsequent generations of Manitobans by\nelectrifying our economy and really showing other jurisdictions across the\nworld that you can have an advanced economy that runs on clean energy and that\ntakes care to address whatever societal and social impacts may be wrought along\nthe way. ","index":"00045","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b> (13:10)\n","index":"00046","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so, certainly, I would very much like to see a strong public\nManitoba Hydro under, you know, very good leadership be able to execute on\nthose goals, as I think it would certainly make not only, you know, us, as, you\nknow, elected representatives, happy, but it would serve the best interests of\nthe people of Manitoba. And we might even suggest that it would serve the best\ninterests of people around the world were they to see a best practice, a case\nstudy example of how you can create economic growth while still reducing\ngreenhouse gas emissions. ","index":"00047","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We know that the workers at Manitoba Hydro are a very important\npart of achieving those goals. And it was just last fall that I think everyone\nin the room is very much aware that we saw the impact that the increasing\nfrequency of storms that climate change brings can have on our hydroelectric\ngrid and the importance of having a strong and stable workforce domestically\nhere in the province is towards being able to guarantee the stability of that\npower grid and the safety of the people who work to maintain it as well as the\nsafety of those Manitobans who rely on it for protection from the elements and,\nyou know, heat in the wintertime. ","index":"00048","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so we were very, very much on board, you know, last fall,\ndriving through the Interlake, driving in the area around Portage la Prairie\nand seeing all the�some cases homemade signs, in some cases LED signs, in other\ncases, you know, roadside signs put up that said, thank you, Hydro workers. We\nvery much appreciated that because it had only at that point been a few days or\nfew weeks where residents in communities along Highway 6 or along Highway 1\nand, you know, areas like that had seen those Manitoba Hydro workers camped out\nin their gymnasiums, in other cases sleeping in their cars, on some days going\nwithout meals, working around the clock to repair the infrastructure, joined in\nmany cases by workers from other jurisdictions, other provinces, also United\nStates of America. ","index":"00049","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And yet we know that while they were celebrated at that time by\nthis provincial government, that the Premier (Mr. Pallister) saw fit to read\nthe names of some of these workers into Hansard and to put on a, you know, show\nof emotion in the Chamber and suggest that these workers were very much\nappreciated, it does seem to confound the authenticity of those statements that\nnow just a few short months later this provincial government would see fit to\norder the layoff of many of these same front-line Manitoba Hydro workers. And\nso, beyond merely chastising the crocodile tears of the Premier, you know, I do\nthink that there is the broader question of the impact that these layoffs and\nthe misguided economic policy on which no economist will sign off that this\ngovernment is pursuing, the impact that that would have on the multiple goals\nthat Manitoba Hydro serves to our province: the economic, the environmental,\nthe social and so on. ","index":"00050","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so I do very much hope that we can arrive at a greater\nunderstanding of the impact that these proposed cuts, unnecessary and harmful\nthat they are, ordered by this Premier and his Cabinet, will have on our\nprovincial economy, the future of our fight against climate change and on the\nvery workers themselves that so many Manitobans rallied around just a few short\nmonths ago.","index":"00051","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now, of course, we're put into the awkward position of having to\nengage in those types of issues by the political interference of this\ngovernment with&nbsp;&nbsp;our most important Crown corporation. But I do&nbsp;&nbsp;also\nhope to perhaps serve some ancillary goals through the form of this committee,\nand I would note that, you know, the CEO, you know, arrived in Manitoba with a\nlot of attention, positive attention, much fanfare, and was awarded for being a\nprominent women business leader, business leader here in the province and\ncertainly brought a lot of accolades and positive attention to Manitoba as\nwell. ","index":"00052","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And the reason why I flag that is because, you know, inasmuch as we\nseek to dive into various financial and human resources and maybe even\nengineering or electrical market questions, you know, I do also hope to gain\nsome insight into the CEO's approach and to the approach of the board chair\nbecause there's certainly an important human dynamic in all of this, and, you\nknow, the insight that we might gain into the leadership styles of the, you\nknow, executive in charge of this Crown and of the board that oversees this\nutility, I do think that that's also an important piece of transparency for the\npeople of Manitoba to have, and so, you know, these are some of the other\nthings that we hoped to ascertain through this process and so, certainly, we\nhave, you know, many questions about, you know, the finances and, you know, the\nfuture projections of Manitoba Hydro, but along the way I hope that we might\nalso gain some insight into, you know, the vision side, the leadership side,\nyou know, how is it that we're going to answer some of the calls that are put\nto us collectively, to use the royal we.","index":"00053","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And I would share the same with the board chair. I know that my\ncolleague and I were speaking beforehand, and they highlighted, I think, your\nleadership in some of their past professional circles and so, you know, I\nextend that same consideration to you as well, that I think that your role on\nthe board is a very important one, and so I do hope to gain some appreciation\nand some insight into how you seek to govern that body and also to help us\nsteer this very important Crown utility.","index":"00054","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so these are some very, very important, I guess, considerations\nfor us both to, you know, get to know the leadership of the Crown a little bit\nbetter perhaps, but also to understand the health of this very, very important\norganization and what it's going to look like in the future, both in the near\nand in the longer term, as well.","index":"00055","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I do thank my colleagues around the table for their\nconsideration in agreeing to sit with us here for some few hours this\nafternoon. Certainly we could sit here for many days, and I suspect that we'd\nhave, you know, only a small glimpse into the complete workings of Manitoba\nHydro, but I do very much appreciate everyone's attention this afternoon.","index":"00056","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so, with that, I would turn it back over to you, Mr. Chair.","index":"00057","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Mr. Chairperson:</b> We thank the member for his statement. Does the\nrepresentative from the Manitoba Hydro-Electric Board wish to make an\nopening�oh. We thank the member for his statement.

So this is my first\ntime in front of the standing committee, and what I'd like to do in response to\nsome of the questions raised by the opposition leadership is provide a\nhigh-level overview of our business and provide updates for the last two years,\nwhich is the last time Manitoba Hydro was in front of this committee. I'd also\nlike to just touch briefly on some of our plans and challenges that we are\ncurrently facing.","index":"00061","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So Manitoba Hydro is one of Canada's largest integrated�vertically\nintegrated electric utilities and that includes electricity as well as natural\ngas distribution. We have 5,000�587,000 customers across Manitoba rely on us\nfor power, for electricity. Two hundred and eighty-five thousand customers,\nprimarily in the southern portion of the province, rely on us to supply them\nwith natural gas, and the natural gas is used for heating, water heating,\ncooking, as well as for industrial uses. Our electricity system is one of the\ngreenest and most renewable in the world, and I'll touch on why that is the\ncase. Ninety-nine per cent of our energy comes from renewable sources that do\nnot&nbsp;&nbsp;emit GHG. Ninety-seven per cent of that comes from our 15\nhydro-electric stations. The remainder, 2&nbsp;per cent, comes from wind-power\npurchases.","index":"00062","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Additionally, we have two natural gas generation plants, both in\nBrandon and Selkirk, but these are primarily used for back-up reliability if\nand when the electricity system isn't able to serve Manitobans. There are also\nfour remote diesel stations in northern�west-northern Manitoba that are in\nIndigenous communities and are unable to be connected to our grid, given the\nlocation and the cost involved.","index":"00063","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(13:20)","index":"00064","speaker":""},{"html":"����� As you may be well aware, Manitoba Hydro exports its surplus power,\nand we also import power when we need to, and I'll touch on both components.\nThe value of exporting the power is Manitobans receive value for every drop of\nwater in our system. Our system is built to serve Manitoban load. It is not built\nfor export, but we optimize the system and use surplus energy and export that\nto the benefit of Manitobans because we forecast on the basis of a minimum\nlevel of water flow and that minimum level of water flow was the 1940 drought\nwhich is the worst on record. ","index":"00065","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Our reservoirs are seasonal reservoirs. Therefore, what we rely on\nin terms of being able to deliver power is precipitation and river flows, but\nprecipi�tation is the primary form of the water that's in our reservoirs. ","index":"00066","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So water flow conditions are critical and have a huge impact on\nManitoba Hydro and Manitobans. So&nbsp;what we do is we plan for the minimum\nscenario and then any surplus energy not required is sold and&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;varies\nyear to year to year depending upon precipitation.","index":"00067","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The firm export contracts we have are based on our dependable\nwater. Everything else is sold in the spot markets because it is not firm, it\nis not reliable; it depends on precipitation. ","index":"00068","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So in the last year and the coming year about $600&nbsp;million in\nrevenue or 21 per cent of our revenue is generated from these firm and spot\nexport sales of surplus water. ","index":"00069","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In terms of the import capability, that's used primarily to serve\nseasonal peaks and for us here in Manitoba that's primarily in January, early\nFebruary when it is coldest. It also allows us to reach into export markets for\nenergy if we have any system reliability issues here. ","index":"00070","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So we're very blessed to have that 99 per cent renewable energy and\nwith that we serve over 130&nbsp;communities within the province. We also do\nnatural gas distribution and 60 per cent of the homes in Manitoba rely on that\nnatural gas for heat. ","index":"00071","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Depending on weather, natural gas can account for up to 20 per cent\nof our revenue, but it's important to understand natural gas because there is\nrhetoric that natural gas is the new coal. That is not the case and that's not\nour view as Manitoba Hydro, because if we were to replace the natural gas that\nis used in Manitoba to provide heat and to serve industrial customers with&nbsp;&nbsp;electricity\nwe would have to double the capacity of our electric generation after Keeyask\ncomes in service�double�and the current water flow and reservoirs are not\ncapable of meeting that. ","index":"00072","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Everyone is well aware that Manitoba Hydro is an asset-intensive\ncompany, and all integrated hydro utilities are asset-intensive. It is the\nnature of our business and we've been going through a period of significant\ngrowth and investment in our assets, and I'd like to speak to what some of\nthose assets are.","index":"00073","speaker":""},{"html":"����� There's Bipole III, and that was built to strengthen reliability.\nIt's an alternate path to flow the energy from the North where it is generated\nto the south where&nbsp;our primary customer base is.
