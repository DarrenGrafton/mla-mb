This study shows that for-profit and\nnot-for-profit homes suffered from the same&nbsp;likelihood of outbreak;\nhowever, in for-profit personal-care homes, those outbreaks led to bigger,\nsevere outbreaks and more seniors' death due to COVID. ","index":"00671","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In addition, there are observational studies that suggest that\nfor-profit long-term-care homes tend to deliver inferior care across a variety\nof outcome and process measures. Now, these include lower levels of quality in\nstaffing, more complaints from residents and family, higher rates of emergency\ndepartment visits, more acute hospital admissions and higher mortality rates.\nEvidence from the United States suggests that for-profit long-term-care homes\nare also more likely to receive deficiency citations for infection control and\nhand hygiene practices.","index":"00672","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The authors from the CMAJ study have identified factors that\nprivate care homes share in common, that have contributed to more severe\nCOVID-19 outbreaks and more COVID-19 deaths. Researchers identified that\nfor-profit homes usually have chain ownership, usually have residents housed in\nbuildings with older, outdated design standards. For-profit homes usually have\npoor ventilation systems and usually have care homes where more seniors are\nhoused together. Now, these factors all contribute to more severe COVID\noutbreaks.

All these studies and investigations bear our attention as\nlegislators. This situation should alert this PC government to question their\ncontinued defence and continued rush to privatize services that would be better\nleft to the public sector. Not just nursing homes, but health care, education\nand other areas where the public interest is at stake. ","index":"00674","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Privatization for this PC government is part of their ideology.\nIt's so ingrained that it's not even questioned.

Now, how do you make profit in personal-care homes?\nLet Revera count the ways: hire racialized and immigrant women who don't\ncomplain about rock-bottom wages and no benefits, hire as few workers as\npossible and give them only part-time hours, buy an old building with outdated\nventilation systems and stuff as many residents as you can in there, multiply\nyour profits by employing a franchise chain model. ","index":"00676","speaker":""},{"html":"����� There is serious money to be made in this for‑profit\nfranchise personal-care home model.

Because over\n80 per cent of care-home residents who have died from COVID-19 lived in\nfacilities run by Revera.

So we owe them that\nrespect. We owe them that respect that they've earned throughout their lives.\nAnd in this time of COVID-19 and in this time of this pandemic, you have to\nquestion whether or not we're giving them the due respect that they've earned,\nthat they deserve.
