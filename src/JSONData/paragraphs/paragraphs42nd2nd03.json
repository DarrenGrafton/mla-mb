Now, to be sure, there is a\nlot of work to do. We have a lot of work to do to earn that trust, but when I\nlook at our caucus, and when I look at our team, I see a team that is getting\ncloser to representing Riel's vision for Manitoba and indeed the vision that\nthis province was founded on.","index":"00381","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now, of course, we have much more work to do. There are certain\naspects where we have to go beyond the vision that Louis Riel articulated here\nin Manitoba. And at this time I'm thinking specifically of the issue of gender,\nwhich Louis Riel did not include in his list of rights. And so, beginning very,\nvery soon, we're going to be bringing forward measures to ensure that everybody\nin Manitoba has the respect and is included by this government, and I'm talking\nabout all expressions of gender there. And over the next few years we will be\nworking very hard to identify, to mentor and to support more women to enter\ninto politics so that we achieve gender equity with the election of our next\ncaucus and of our future Cabinet.","index":"00382","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now, this is an important step, along with other issues of\nrepresentation, that we all must take seriously here. And when we achieve these\ngoals, we will all be the benefactors of that progress. Indeed, our democracy\nworks best when everyone's voices are included, and I say that in terms of\ngender, I say that in terms of cultural communities, I say that in terms of\neconomic backgrounds.

","index":"00383","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Climate change is one of the defining issues of our time, Mr.\nDeputy Speaker. One of the reasons why I entered into politics is because I\nwant to help solve the climate crisis. Now, let's be clear: future generations\nwill judge us by the way that we respond to the threat of global warming, and, specifically,\nfuture generations will judge us by the way that we responded to this threat of\nglobal warming over the next decade.

","index":"00385","speaker":""},{"html":"And so we know what is needed in order to address\nthe issue of climate change, Mr. Deputy Speaker. We have to set targets that\nwill help us end global warming. We have to put in place job-creating policies\nthat will allow us to achieve those targets. But&nbsp;&nbsp;importantly, if\npoliticians and political leaders fail to achieve those targets, then there\nmust be accountability, and we should exercise accountability as severely as we\ndo when governments fail to balance their budgets.

So that's why, in my own life and in my own\nhome, I am trying to take many steps to try and improve the impact that I have\non the environment.

And, unfortunately, I was not surprised when\nthey brought forth their Throne Speech that the document that we had prepared a\nweek in advance pretty neatly anticipated the announcements that they were\nabout to make. ","index":"00391","speaker":""},{"html":"So to draw your attention to a few of these priority\nareas, we know that there is a continued emphasis on cutting health care on the\npart of this government. And so we propose a different approach that sees us\nmove upstream and invest in keeping people healthy in the community and healthy\nat home so that we can not only make the health-care system more sustainable in\nthe long term, but also guarantee a strong quality of life for Manitobans for\nmany, many years to come. ","index":"00392","speaker":""},{"html":"When we turn to education, we know that this\ngovernment is intent on launching an education review whose predetermined\noutcomes likely include the amalgamation of school divisions, reduction in the\namount of teachers and cuts to education funding�in fact, they campaigned on\ncutting education funding in the recent election�whereas we view education as\nan investment in young people that will help them adapt to the changing\ntechnology-driven society, which is continuing its evolution all around us. ","index":"00393","speaker":""},{"html":"Now, I've spoken with�Mr. Deputy Speaker, I've\nspoken with many tech experts, and what they tell me is that for sure you need\nwhat are called hard skill training: math, science, STEM topics. You need to be\nable to code and things like that. But many of these tech leaders tell me that\nthose skills are often out of date within two to five years after being\nacquired by a learner. And so what young people really need to be&nbsp;able to\ndo during their educational journeys is to learn the ability to be autodidacts.\nSpelled more clearly and maybe a more conversational way, young people need to\nlearn about lifelong learning. They need to develop the critical thinking, creative\nthinking and collaborative skills that will allow them to adapt to a changing\nworld and a changing environment. ","index":"00394","speaker":""},{"html":"One of the best ways for young people to get this is\nto have a strong education from the K-to-12 level, but then also, you know, to\nhave access to good college programs, to have good access to liberal arts\nundergraduate educations and then to have access to professional training as\nwell, should they choose to further their educations in that direction.","index":"00395","speaker":""},{"html":"Now, unfortunately, what we've seen so far from this\ngovernment is a refusal to recognize that that is the way the world is headed\nand that young people ought to be able to have those academic freedoms and\nacademic opportunities at their disposal. Instead, we're seeing a narrowing of\nthe focus of education and vision, if you could even call it that, on the part\nof this government, that renders young people into simply being cogs in the\nmachine.","index":"00396","speaker":""},{"html":"Now, recently, we have also been talking a lot about\npublic safety and the issue of crime in the province of Manitoba. In the recent\nThrone Speech, we saw a very narrow dealing with the topic, one that failed to\ndeal with addressing the root causes. So what we advocate for on this side of\nthe House is that we need immediate steps to make sure that people feel safe\nand secure in our communities right across Manitoba. But we also, at the same\ntime, need to pay attention to the long-term investments that are needed to\nturn the issue of crime and violence in our communities into a more positive\ndirection.","index":"00397","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so, from our recent alternative throne speech, I'd highlight\njust a couple of ideas. One is to provide stable operating funding to the Bear\nClan Patrol. Whether you're in Brandon, here in Winnipeg, Selkirk, other\ncommunities, I think we all recognize the good work that Bear Clan is doing to\nprovide a link between community members and services and, in some cases, even\nlaw enforcement. ","index":"00398","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now, the other issue that I wanted to present from&nbsp;the\nalternative throne speech on this topic that I think is a good one that the\ngovernment ought to pay attention to is the idea of placing community resources\nled by organizations like Fearless R2W, Aboriginal Youth Opportunities, Mama\nBear Clan and others into schools where they could interact with young people. ","index":"00399","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Many of us in this Chamber are familiar with school resource\nofficers. These are police officers who are placed into schools. They attend\nhigh school hockey games. They attend graduation ceremonies. They attend, you\nknow, just school on a day-to-day level, talking to kids in the hallway, the\nidea being that they can build a link between the students and the police\nservices so that they can help better connect with young people when they are\nin need. ","index":"00400","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so what we're proposing is to use a similar model, but to place\ncommunity-based allies into those positions, so that you might have somebody\nlike a Michael Champaign in a school like William Whyte, and then they notice\nwhen a young person hasn't been there for a few days�hey, is everything okay?\nIs there something going on at home that we can help you with? Could we maybe\nrecommend that you talk to somebody who might be able to assist you with some\nof the challenges?","index":"00401","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And, if we lower the barriers to entry for people asking for help,\nif we meet young people where they're at, if we wrap them with services and\naccess to a pathway to success that begins with education, continues through\npost-secondary, advances with a good job that pays a living wage and then, of\ncourse, continues on to home ownership and the building of generational wealth\nfor that family, then that is when we are going to truly transform things into\nour society into being one where each of us can be proud inheritors of Louis\nRiel's legacy and the articulators of his vision. <i>[interjection]</i> I want\nto thank my colleague, Matt�or thank my colleague from Concordia there for his\ncontinued dedication to this mission, and it's one that I take very seriously. ","index":"00402","speaker":""},{"html":"And so, over the next few years, but this session in\nparticular, you are going to see us pushing to not just honour Louis Riel's\nvision and legacy with words, but to do so with actions. And so as long as God\nis willing and as long as the river doesn't rise, I will be here each and every\nday, pushing forward on that front. And so I thank you for your attention, Mr.&nbsp;Deputy\nSpeaker. ","index":"00403","speaker":""},{"html":"����� However,\nif you've been listening carefully to question period and the Throne Speech,\nyou will know&nbsp;that this government has already failed in their\nresponsibility to govern responsibly for the people of Manitoba. And so it is with\ngreat hesitation, but indeed, after careful deliberation, that I now move an\namendment that will culminate with this government falling, the triggering of a\nnew general election and the election of a new NDP government for our 150th&nbsp;anniversary.","index":"00404","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Some Honourable\nMembers:</b> Oh, oh.","index":"00405","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Mr. Kinew:</b> Maybe.
