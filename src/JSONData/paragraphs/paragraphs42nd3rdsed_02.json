After all, what\ncould be better than the two primary stakeholders on an issue coming to full\nagreement and giving government their assurance that their recommendations are\nworkable and practical.

As a result of the\nexamination by the RMs, Cornwallis and Elton reached the conclusion that they\nwished to branch off on their own and partner in a planning district tailored\nto their circumstances resulting in Brandon becoming a stand-alone planning\nentity.

The BAPD partners have worked\ncollaboratively with Minister Squires and her team to establish a new structure\nfor the District where the rural partners will continue providing services\nunder the newly named Keystone Planning District (KPD) independent of the City\nof Brandon. This new structure will provide increased autonomy/processing\nefficiency for the KPD and the City of Brandon with intermunicipal planning\nfacilitated through a new joint planning committee. The Province of Manitoba\ngranting subdivision approval authority to the City of Brandon under Bill 7 and\nadopting a regulation with a new boundary and name for the BAPD are necessary\nchanges to move this process forward.","index":"00460","speaker":""},{"html":"The District appreciates your attention\nto this matter.","index":"00461","speaker":""},{"html":"Sincerely,","index":"00462","speaker":""},{"html":"Jeff Fawcett","index":"00463","speaker":""},{"html":"Chair, Brandon\n&amp; Area Planning District","index":"00464","speaker":""}]}
