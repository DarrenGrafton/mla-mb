The public school system is\nprimarily concerned with education and welfare of students. School and system\nadministration must reflect the primacy of teaching and learning. That's the\ncore task of that institution, is to enhance learning.

They're creating a climate hospitable to education, and they\ndo that with laser focus. </span>","index":"00022","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� So principals are mentors, Madam Speaker. One of\ntheir main roles is to mentor staff. They want to create that culture of\ncontinual professional development and improvement. They monitor and evaluate\nstaff.

The\nwhole school is diminished in that situation. </span>","index":"00024","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� So why do we need this bill now, Madam Speaker? We\nneed this bow�bill now more than ever because it's going to send a signal to\nthis Legislature that we value public education.

Businesses are not.\nSchools work through collaboration, not through competition. We do not believe\nthat there should be winners and losers in schools. All students should be\nwinners.

It gives you good perspective on how you should treat those\nindividuals, because when you're experiencing addiction, for example�and my\nwife and I, not that we took pleasure in this, but we definitely recognized a\nneed within our own community that there were members of our community that\nwere suffering from addictions, addictions to alcohol, addictions to drugs,\naddictions to pornography.

It might be more\ndifficult; we acknowledge that. There are roads that are easier for some than\nothers, but there are still choices, and I&nbsp;&nbsp;know, you know, growing\nup, much like the Premier (Mr. Pallister), we didn't have much.
