I'm 36 years old and I currently live in West Broadway, in the riding\nof Union Station.

This Bill\n51 is one of 19 bills that was introduced in late 2020 with no text and without\nevidence that the text had indeed been developed before the bills were tabled.\nBy releasing the text of 19 bills over a short time period with so little time\nfor public review and consideration, the Manitoba government is effectively\nobstructing meaningful participation by the public in the legislative process.","index":"00045","speaker":""},{"html":"����� My\npresentation today represents only a fraction of the research that I believe is\nabsolutely necessary before this bill could be passed into law, and I am\ncertain that with adequate time to prepare and to request information, I would\npresent a far more detailed and nuanced analysis of Bill 51. ","index":"00046","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I\nwant to start by considering some of the limitations that this bill sets out\nand how it compares to other provinces. When the text of the bill was finally\nreleased, Justice Minister Cameron Friesen stated in an official announcement that\nBill 51 will bring Manitoba in line with other provinces that have already\nsimplified and modernized other limitations law.

Instead, it seems that the provincial government has done\nexactly the opposite. If passed, Bill 51 will demand that any claims\nmade�placed on Aboriginal and treaty rights, affirmed by the constitution, must\nbe commenced in court within 30&nbsp;years of the act or a mission taking\nplace. ","index":"00049","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nAssembly of Manitoba Chiefs has stated that no First Nations groups were\nconsulted before the bill was tabled, and they have called on the provincial\ngovernment to remove limitations that restrict Indigenous peoples from\naddressing historical injustices. My understanding is that there is no\njurisdiction in Canada that places limitations on claims based on existing\nAboriginal and treaty rights of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada that are\nrecognized and affirmed in the Constitution Act, 1982. ","index":"00050","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I can\nthus only assume that the intention of the current government is not to bring\nManitoba in line with other provinces, and that Bill 51 is rather intended to\nobstruct and undermine the rights that are recognized and affirmed in the\nConstitution Act.

Bill 51 proposes to cut this time in half to 15 years. At\nthe same time, I noticed that the proposed changes to The Freedom of\nInformation and Protection of Privacy Act would extend the time for responding\nto a request for access to information from 30 days to 45&nbsp;days.

I'll make just a few brief comments in respect of the bill, The\nLimitations Act, and indicate again to the committee that the bill proposes to\nrepeal and replace the current limitations legislation with a modern and\nsimplified approach that better aligns with other jurisdictions. And, in so\ndoing, the new act sets out a specific limitation period: a two-year basic\nperiod and then a 15-year ultimate period. Right now in Manitoba there are\nvarious limitations for different things. That can be confusing. It's\ninefficient and, clearly, in other provinces, and speaking to the concerns\nraised by tonight's presenter, there has been a coherent move towards provinces\nestablishing similar limits in respect of the�both the ultimate and the basic\nlimitation period.
