I didn't read it in the bill. Government said, in a news release from\nNovember 27th, 2019, that it intends to relax the solvency funding rules for a\ndefined benefit pension plan.

Although we\nprobably differ, in terms of the unlocking piece, really what our intent to\ndo�just to unpack a few things you mentioned, was the unlocking piece. Of\ncourse, you can do that 50 per cent right now under the current legislation. ","index":"00073","speaker":"Scott Fielding"},{"html":"����� The\nfinancial hardship piece, it's something that most jurisdictions have done, and\nso that's, of course, you know, someone's got, let's say, health issues or\nmaybe their kid or child needs to go to the States or something for some\nmedical conditions or whatever it is, or you're kind of behind in your rent or\nyour mortgage. So you're able to unlock some of the�your pension, essentially,\nto deal with those important issues.","index":"00074","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nyou know, this is something that I get calls on quite a bit from the minister's\noffice, just people looking to unlock some of their savings. You know, I think\nwe're probably going to disagree. I generally think, for the most part, it is,\nyou know, it is a worker's money, and so they can make their own choices. ","index":"00075","speaker":""},{"html":"����� You\nknow, a little bit different from Saskatchewan, where they're allowing, I think\nafter 55, 100 per cent of their pension to be unlocked. Now that doesn't force\nthem to do that. They can keep it in some sort of, you know, fund or they can\nmove it to some other vehicle to have savings or they can use it whichever way\nthey would like.","index":"00076","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nagain, there's three ways to do it: unlocking under kind of a severe, you know,\nany�some sort of circumstances that are there; No. 2 is the 50 per cent\nparameter that's already in place in the legislation; No.&nbsp;3, at 65 you're\nable to unlock that.","index":"00077","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Also,\njust in terms of the education, I do want to thank you for the letter you sent\nme, in terms of the education.

That is based on what\nother provinces have done. Ontario, for instance, moved in that general\ndirection. I think Quebec has 75 per cent. Nova Scotia, I believe, is moving in\nthat direction and the other few of the provinces are looking at it.","index":"00081","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Essentially,\nit's kind of a best practice in pensions, I guess I would suggest and, you\nknow, if you are able to move to the solvency piece, what it probably prevents\nis people moving their pensions from a defined benefit to defined contribution.\n","index":"00082","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, I\nguess that's maybe some points I would make in respect to all of those. ","index":"00083","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Mr.\nRebeck:</b> Yes, no, I think I'm hearing a mixed message there that I'm not\nclear on.","index":"00084","speaker":""},{"html":"����� My\nquestion was: in a news release it talked about moving from 100 per cent to 85\nper cent. I think you're saying that is the intent. I don't see that written in\nthe bill, so I assumed we were leaving it at 100 per cent funding. I hope\nthat's the case and that we aren't moving to 85 per cent, but I think I hear\nyou saying that the intent is to move to 85 per cent solvency funding.

","index":"00087","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Mr.\nRebeck: </b>Yes. My worry is that when a company goes bankrupt, like Sears,\nthat workers don't get paid their deferred wages. Pension plans are workers'\ndeferred wages; it's money that they've earned, that they've put away, that's\nbeing held in trust and to be there for when they retire. And when we aren't\nfunding things at 100 per cent solvency rate and things go bad, workers are the\nlosers in that scenario.","index":"00088","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So we\nthink it's important to keep it at 100&nbsp;&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent solvency, that\nthere may be situations where an exception may need to be made, and that&nbsp;&nbsp;should\nbe with the support of plan members being part of that call for government\nrelief to give a variance.

","index":"00090","speaker":"Tom Lindsey"},{"html":"I guess the\nother question I have is by the government deciding to change the solvency\nrate, and yet the minister says it's the workers' money, and yet by changing\nthat solvency requirement, he's allowing employers to take a break at the\nworkers' expense that, if a place goes bankrupt, like you said, with Sears,\nthere isn't money in the pension plan and then along with other changes that they\nproposed here, it's all about weakening the collective power of that pension\nplan, which will leave all workers worse off.","index":"00091","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Is\nthat kind of a fair statement? ","index":"00092","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Mr.\nRebeck:</b> Yes. I think that's a fair statement. I think when you've released\nsolvency rules, you're really giving an employer a free access to a loan of\nemployers' money, and in the event that things go wrong or bankruptcy occurs,\nthey don't have to pay that back and they've used workers' money to finance\nthings.

Anything that puts the solvency of our system at\nrisk or that potentially changes the fundamental nature of the benefit to be\nreceived, as this bill does, will be met with profound skepticism and even\noutright fear by health-care professionals, who are already deeply concerned\nabout a range of issues related to their jobs, including safety, working\nconditions and so much more.","index":"00276","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I also\nunderstand that the changes being sold are using high-level terms like\nflexibility and choice and perhaps even freedom.

","index":"00278","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I'm\nnot going to go into great detail, as you can read them for yourself and you've\nheard from Mr.&nbsp;Rebeck earlier this evening, as well. But they do include\nthe following points: No.&nbsp;1, we must keep the solvency requirement for\npension plans where it is, at 100 per cent, with some flexibility to address\nemergent and urgent and momentary needs that some plans may face and any\nchanges subject to approval by plan members. We must work with other provinces\nand territories and with the federal government to create a Canada-wide\nmandatory pension insurance program that promises�to ensure that promises,\npardon me, to workers are kept. ","index":"00279","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Then,\nagain, I will reiterate what many have said already this evening. We must\neliminate or mitigate provisions that would make it easier for workers to\nunlock funds intended for retirement, except in extreme financial hardship. The\nproposed changes would open up our members to a level of risk that they're not\nnecessarily well equipped to navigate. And it also opens up our retirement\nfunds to financial services industry that would profit off their hard-earned\nretirement funds, while offering zero guaran�tees in return, the significant\nlikelihood that many members would be worse off due to these changes and that\nthe plan itself would be put at risk for the rest of us.

But temporary measures can be done without\ncreating permanent change to Manitoba's pension landscape. We were initially\npleased to see the government seemed to have moved off its position of having\nan 85 per cent solvency rule in the bill. We are now greatly disappointed to\nhear that you're moving towards that 85 per cent through regulation. This does\nnot help working Manitobans.

However, other juris�dictions, when\nmoving to a rule, have offsetting provisions to protect workers' pension.

You did this to a paper mill that I serviced, the Canadian\nKraft Paper mill in The Pas, formerly owned by Tolko. At least twice in the\npast 15 years, the Manitoba government offered temporary pension relief to the\nmill owners on the solvency payments that were required to be made.

And shortly prior to that, the big hot topic on the table at that\npoint in time was musculoskeletal injuries, and we got some pretty good\nlanguage about that and some good decisions and some good WCB policy around\nthat, which could be argued on implementation, but we did a lot of work on that\nin the early 2000s and to mid-2000s.

There's the worker adviser versus employer advocacy office. I'm\ngoing to start with that piece right there because I don't think that anything\nwhere you tag on employer to�helping with any sort of appeal of a claim is\nbeneficial to the system. The whole compromise that happened in the early 1900s\ndid not contemplate employers having extra resources on top of the resources\nthat they already have to appeal workers' compensation claims, and that's\nsimply what it is.","index":"00992","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nreason why we have an extremely under-resourced worker adviser office is\nbecause workers just simply don't have those resources.

","index":"00993","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And if\nyou've ever been through a workers compensation claim or advocated for somebody\non a workers compensation claim, you'll know that Workers Compensation does an\nextremely poor job at advising and educating workers of their rights throughout\nthe process. A simple form template letter that's gone out to every single\ninjured worker, advising them of the appeal process, isn't enough for them to\nunderstand exactly how to make their way and navigate probably the most\ncomplicated system many of them will ever make their way through.

I was part of the very first\nclaim suppression penalty that was ever handed out in Manitoba. I'd be happy to\ntell that story; please ask. But the bottom line is, the last claim suppression\npenalty that I've seen go through the system took about three years. That was\nthree years of a worker suffering. I've seen one go through the system where it\nturned out to be claim suppression but the worker's claim was denied after they\nwere outside�assaulted outside of a grocery store. ","index":"00997","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So the\npiece on enforcement basically wraps around everything because it's not just\nenforcement on employers abusing the system, it's enforcement on WCB not\nenforcing their own act, not acting within their own act, not acting within\ntheir own policies, not acting within their own regulations. ","index":"00998","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Brings\nme to my next point, which is PTSD and the presumption piece, and how we can\nhave presumption applied in different ways in multiple areas of the\nworkplace�Workers Compensation Act is mind-boggling to me.

I personally have helped workers navigate their\npost-traumatic stress claims and I see in there the Workers Compensation not\neven using the current model of the DSM to adjudicate a claim, and when asked\nabout that they didn't know that there was a new DSM model.

We need\nthis compensation. There's a reason why this was there, and there was a reason\nwhy there was a historical compromise back in the early 1900s. ","index":"01008","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nclaim suppression isn't just employers abusing the compensation system, which\nI've seen many times. I read files and I see in the files workers report to the\nWorkers Compensation that my employer told me not to do this, my employer tried\nto stop me from doing this, and Workers Compensation isn't even reporting that\nto their own enforcement branch. They're not even turning around and saying,\nhey, we've got a claim here, we're going to adjudicate that claim, but in the\nmeantime you should go look into this because this worker is telling me that\ntheir employer tried to stop them from filing the claim.

By allowing employers to water down the solvency requirements\nfrom 100 per cent to 85 per cent, I can tell you that employers may lose out.\nWe've seen any number of high-profile pensions that workers were left at the\nend of a bankruptcy case with nothing. So if the government wants to change\nsolvency requirements, then they should introduce legislation that protects workers\nand puts them at the top of the pecking order rather than banks and investors,\nbut they haven't done that.","index":"01064","speaker":""},{"html":"����� By\nallowing workers to withdraw money from their pensions to take care of\nimmediate needs, immediate needs that have been exacerbated by this government\ndue to laying workers off, due to freezing workers' wages, due to not\nsupporting workers properly throughout this pandemic, it really has put workers\nin a position where they're in danger of losing their house today or tomorrow,\nand it's a tough choice&nbsp;&nbsp;for workers to have to make: should I take\nmoney out of my pension now to make my mortgage payments, knowing full well\nthat when I retire I won't have enough money to stay in my house either? This\ngovernment has failed workers again with these changes.","index":"01065","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nother problem with workers taking money out of their pensions, it leaves the\nentire pension plan less able to be sustainable, because the whole basis of,\nparticularly defined benefit pension plans, is everybody supports everybody by\nhaving their money in the plan.

And then I saw\nthem working at Walmart about a year later and asked, what's going on? Well,\nthey lost all their money. Downturn in the economy.

Employers do a pretty good job of that on their own already,\nand the compensation board does a pretty good job of that already. The last\nthing a worker needs is someone else ganging up to deny them the coverage that\nthey should be entitled to. We know that the worker adviser office is horribly\nunderstaffed and under-resourced; there's no such thing as a worker adviser\noffice in the North anymore.

A lot of times a worker will lose that claim simply because\nthey didn't report it within 24 hours.
