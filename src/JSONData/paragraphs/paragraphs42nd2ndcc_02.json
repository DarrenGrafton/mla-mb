However, the House is not sitting at this time due to the government's\nchoice for us not to sit, so I did want to make these remarks into Hansard so\nthat posterity does have some record of this important time in our continent's\nhistory and, of course, in the progress towards justice that I hope we are able\nto make out of this period.","index":"00057","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Also,\nI just want to note in passing, for posterity, that a great, well-respected\nelder by the name of Percy Houle, passed away, from the Ebb and Flow First\nNation, and so my thoughts are certainly with his family as well. ","index":"00058","speaker":""},{"html":"����� As far\nas the matter at hand today, you know, we're actually joined, in the form of\noil paintings, by two figures who are very important to the history of Manitoba\nPublic Insurance. It was Premier Schreyer, I think, who really spearheaded the\ncreation of it, but it was former-Premier Howard Pawley, who was a Cabinet\nminister in charge of the file, who oversaw the creation of Autopac back in the\nday. And many people that I've spoken to say that it's one of the most\ncourageous things that a Manitoba government has done, because, back when\nHoward Pawley was a Cabinet minister, he was sent out on the steps of the\nbuilding to greet 1,000 angry insurance brokers and to try and persuade to them\nwhy creating a public insurer in Manitoba would lead to a good outcome for all\npeople and how they could, perhaps, also still be made whole by the government\nof the day","index":"00059","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so\nwe know that Autopac's history in the province has been very interesting, to\nsay the least, and certainly at this very unique time in our province's\nhistory, where we are dealing with a pandemic and we're dealing with a\nunprecedented recession and, of course, the impact on the financial markets\nthat have first cratered and then shot back up, I think it is important to\npause for a moment and to just reflect on that history, to note that MPI's\nhistory has not always been an easy one, but, certainly, when we look at the\nlower rates that we have in this province and we look at the protection that is\nafforded to Manitobans, that those moves, difficult as they may have been,\nultimately led to a greater standard of well-being and a greater quality of\nlife for people in the province of Manitoba. ","index":"00060","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, as\nmy colleague from St. James mentioned, this is the first time the committee has\nsat since September 2017, and certainly quite a lot has happened since that\ntime. I'm sure, you know, the CEO and board chair could educate us at great\nlength as to all the changes that have happened during that period, but a few\nthings stand out to my mind. We know that the vehicle-for-hire industry was\nlaunched in that period and certainly represented a very big emerging business\nsector that interacts with MPI quite a bit. Certainly that meant a lot of\nchanges for the taxi industry who also have a lot in interaction with MPI. ","index":"00061","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And,\nof course, there's been a number of moves in terms of not necessarily Autopac's\ninsuring of those businesses, but in the regulation of that sector, and it\nhaving been handed over to the City of Winnipeg from the Province, which is at\nleast a tangential issue of interest towards the public insurer, I'm sure. ","index":"00062","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I'd\nalso note the mandatory entry level training for truck drivers. Certainly, the\nissue of safety has been brought to mind. There's been a lot of good public\ninterest journalism on the topic. Particularly last year there was a number of\nseries of investigative reports that helped to underline the importance of that\ntopic, and I think we're all very mindful of that. ","index":"00063","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nthroughout this period, I think most recently we are all probably thinking\nabout the pandemic, and I'd note that MPI has been very active, seemingly,\nthrough this period, both in terms of redeploying human resources. I received a\ncheque in the mail this week, which was also, I guess, a very public display of\nMPI's activities. And, of course, I think there's many other aspects of the\nbusiness that have certainly been disrupted, changed or otherwise interrupted\nby the COVID-19 experience. ","index":"00064","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Yet,\nthroughout it all, I suspect that achieving better value for the ratepayers in\nManitoba is an overarching concern, as is the safety and, of course, the\nobservance of good governance practices with respect to this very important\nCrown corporation. ","index":"00065","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We\nknow that, you know, the government of the day here in Manitoba has interfered\nwith Manitoba Public Insurance on numerous occasions. And the&nbsp;&nbsp;media\nhas pointed out that with the Premier (Mr.&nbsp;Pallister) being an insurance\nbroker, that certainly he has some very close ties and perhaps some conflicts\nthat ought to be addressed when it comes to the questions around the governance\nand oversight of this very important Crown corporation. ","index":"00066","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In\nfact, we know that last year the board of MPI sought legal advice to clarify\nthe board's role and responsibilities. I believe this is somewhat of a\nrhetorical move, or perhaps we could find a better, more accurate adjective to\ndescribe it later on in this process because I think any layperson, any common sense\nperson with experience serving on boards would understand what the roles and\nresponsibilities are. However, it was likely the extenuating circumstances of\nthis government's interference that led them down such a path to seek that\nexternal counsel. ","index":"00067","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I'd\nalso note that the Public Utilities Board has clarified that the Pallister\ngovernment has no right to interfere in the process of setting automotive rates\nin the province here. So, again, I think that whether you're on the left-wing\nor the right-wing perspective, an open-minded economic analysis would suggest\nthat it's very important that there be, when a Crown corporation has monopoly\npower in a market such as MPI does here in Manitoba, it's very important that\nthere should be a free and open process to determine the process by which rates\nare set so that the monopoly power is not abused and that consumers actually\nare getting good value for their services that are being rendered to them, but\nalso that, you know, they have some fair say and fair input into that process\nas well. ","index":"00068","speaker":""},{"html":"����� One\nsubject of great interest to me is the provision of online services in\nManitoba. I know this is also one that has been very�bit of a hot topic, I\nwould say, perhaps, and insurance brokers in Manitoba have certainly raised\nconcerns, and I'm very, you know, live to those concerns. You know, there's\nmany business owners and employees across the province who probably have\nconcerns about their lives, their work being disrupted. ","index":"00069","speaker":""},{"html":"����� At the\nsame time, it seems to me that if you just simply watch a television commercial\nand see what sort of insurance products are offered in neighbouring\njurisdictions, whether that's other provinces or America, that there are much\nmore advanced online services offered in those jurisdictions, and so it seems\nthat MPI's a bit behind the eight ball, perhaps not due to any sort of lack of\ncunning or innovation within the organization, but just the requirement to work\nthrough those public processes here in Manitoba and to build a consensus. ","index":"00070","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(13:20)","index":"00071","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So it\nis my hope that we can expedite that process in consensus building and, you\nknow, bring brokers along as they were brought along in the 1970s and ensure\nthat, at the end of the day, Manitobans do have access to online services that\nare comparable or perhaps even better than that available to consumers in other\nprovinces or in the United States. ","index":"00072","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nthese are some of the issues that I think my colleagues and I are very aware\nof, very live to, and we would like to see addressed today. Certainly, there's,\nI think, a lot of details that we in the public would like to get to in terms\nof, you know, just the nature of how this COVID pandemic has impacted the\nbusiness. But I thought I'd touch on a few of those key areas, just at a high\nlevel, to begin just to sort of telegraph, if you will, what some of our\nintentions are to cover in this committee. And so, again, hopefully, that does\nhelp�maybe help formulate some of the thoughts and some of the discussion that\nwe're going to have here. ","index":"00073","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And,\nif I might, beyond that I would just say that I am also very interested, you\nknow, in this setting to get to know some of our guests a little bit better.\nYou know, I haven't had the opportunity to engage directly very often, though I\ndo understand, having looked at the CVs, that we're joined by two very\nintelligent people. You know, somebody's very distinguished here in the\nprovince and somebody who's certainly got a global track record and a lot of\ngood ideas. ","index":"00074","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\ninasmuch as we have the opportunity to engage with the issues that I just kind\nof spelled out there, very much looking forward to that. But then also just,\nyou know, the very good, you know, open-minded way, hopefully, get a little bit\nof a sense for the approach of both the chair and the CEO through this project�","index":"00075","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Mr.\nChairperson:</b> Mr. Kinew, your time has expired.

","index":"00080","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Good\nafternoon to everyone in attendance. This is my first appearance at a standing\ncommittee meeting, so I thought I would introduce myself a little bit before we\nstart in earnest. ","index":"00081","speaker":""},{"html":"����� My\nname is Ben Graham. I've been the President and CEO of MPI since February of\n2018. With the support of the board that hired me, I've been brought into this\nprovince to focus on the fundamentals of core insurance. And you'll start to\nsee, as a result of that, very shortly. ","index":"00082","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I do\nlook forward to overviewing the annual reports and annual financial statements\nfor the years ending in 2018 and 2019. However, I would like to&nbsp;&nbsp;first\nquickly highlight some of the notable achievements which are included in a slide\ndeck. I believe you each have a copy. I only want to focus on a few of those\nslides. I thought it was interesting just to provide you with a little bit of\ncontext of the corporation, with a real clear overview on the level of fiscal\nprudence that we have been applying over the last two to two and a half years. ","index":"00083","speaker":""},{"html":"����� At\nthis time, I would like to thank all of the staff at MPI, be it from our driver\nexaminers to our adjusters to our estimators, CPU, service centre operations,\nall the head office staff and, lastly, the board, for their support in getting\nthe results that we are now starting to see at MPI. ","index":"00084","speaker":""},{"html":"����� When I\nfirst came on, we looked at our vision as a corporation and we moved it to be\nthe trusted auto insurance and driver services provider for every Manitoban. To\nrealize this vision, we have undertaken a lot of changes over the last couple\nof years, focused on three major areas: transparency, fiscal prudence and\ncustomer service. ","index":"00085","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Firstly,\nI want to touch on transparency, both with our internal and external\nstakeholders. I'm sure you will note that we now have a very strong and\ntrustworthy relationship with the Public Utilities Board, and you'll have that\nnoted in the last two orders that have been made by them in relation to our\ngeneral rate application. ","index":"00086","speaker":""},{"html":"Transparency has also been expressed through a clear accountability to\nour customers�those that must purchase insurance from MPI. Starting this year,\nall of our renewal notices include a very detailed breakdown of where your\npremium dollars go. There's no secret coffers. Every dollar, we will show you\nwhere it goes within the corporation. It's a clear demonstration to every\nManitoban that their dollars are being put to good use.","index":"00087","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Finally,\nI believe our transparency with both our staff and the MGEU have been fantastic\nthroughout our ongoing pandemic planning. <span lang=\"EN-US\">As you will know,\nI'm sure there'll be some questions on our response to COVID-19 and our strong\nrelationship with them will be brought to the fore when it comes to discussing\nthose.</span>","index":"00088","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� Last but not least, in relation to transparency,\nat the back of the presentation deck�unfortunately for those in attendance,\ninsurance and some of the topics that we discuss can be quite boring, so to\nconfuse people we talk in acronyms. There's a full listing of some of the acronyms\nwe might discuss in there so that we don't have to stop every three minutes and\nexplain the acronym for everyone in this room. </span>","index":"00089","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� Touching on the key topic for today and\nspecifically in relation to the annual reports, if you can turn to slide 15 of the\nslide deck, I just want to run through a few of the fiscal prudence components\nthat we've been working on at the corporation for the last two years. </span>","index":"00090","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� Slide 15 is a clear demonstration of some of the\nkey metrics of any insurance company. You will notice that since February 2018\nour loss ratio is down, technical income is significantly up, operating\nexpenses continue to be managed prudently, and all of this equates to a very\nsimple answer, and that is lower rates for Manitobans. </span>","index":"00091","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� If you go to the next slide, again, minimum\ncapital test is an industry standard that is used in previous years. If you\nlook at, you know, 2015, '16, '17, the corporation was almost technically\ninsolvent. We had the lowest MCT ratio of any insurance company in North\nAmerica. </span>","index":"00092","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� Through work of the board and the executive and\nsupport by government, we have been moving to increase that MCT ratio towards\n100 per cent. That was recently enshrined in regulation. </span>","index":"00093","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� The purpose of MCT is to avoid any rate shock in\nthe future if we have a bad year. Because of the things we have done at MPI in\nrecent years, as the percentage goes up, the actual amount of capital needed to\nhold reduces because of the steps that we have taken in relation to reinsurance\nand asset liability management, as well as ERM.</span>","index":"00094","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� I'll also talk a little bit, although I'm sure\nthere'll be some questions later in relation to the PUB and the capital\nmanagement plan, and we'd obviously like to discuss that with you. Again, a\none-in-three year reduction in MCT to give money back to Manitobans, but if we\ndo have some bad years and we need to build back up to 100 per cent, we will do\nit prudently over a five-year period as to avoid rate increases of shock to the\npaying public.</span>","index":"00095","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� On the next slide, one of the larger components of\nthe volatility equation is reinsurance. You will note, on the left-hand side,\nthe reinsurance program that I inherited back in 2018. Of note, in 2015-16, we\nhad a year of $53 million of hail losses of which we only recovered $900,000.\nReinsurance is a program in place to avoid such volatility, but the way that\nthe program was placed did not provide that level of protection to Manitobans. </span>","index":"00096","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� Subsequently, we went and met with our reinsurance\nbroker and placed the first-in-Canada, single-aggregate, tower-based program,\nwhich effect�ively eliminates volatility from our earning cycle. How does that\nhappen is that we retain the first $35&nbsp;million. We budget that amount. If\nwe have a good year, we're under budget and that excess capital will then go\nback into the pockets of Manitobans through the rate hearing the following\nyear. </span>","index":"00097","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� If we have a year of, say, $80 million worth of\nhail, we have a stop-loss of $35 million. We will not pay a single cent more.\nSo as you can see, it significantly reduces volatility in our earnings and any\nincreases in premiums for Manitobans. Of note, after being the first to be\nplaced in Canada, the following year six similar structures were placed in the\nmarket by other insurers. </span>","index":"00098","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� The following slide, slide 18�I know you have\nprobably heard the term flatten the curve, over and over, over the last three\nmonths. For insurance companies, that's probably the opposite of what we want\nto do when it comes to modelled outcomes. So we want to make sure that we\nnarrow the amount of volatility in our earnings. </span>","index":"00099","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(13:30)","index":"00100","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� An example of that, and through the work of the\nboard and some of the great minds that we have on there, especially when it\ncomes to investment strategy, if you look at our asset-liability management\nprogram, </span>through a 47 per cent reduction in value-at-risk, for a\ntrade-off of an 8 per cent reduction in technical investment income, we have\nobviously a lot less volatility in our earnings or modelled outcomes, as is\nseen through these models that we run at MPI on a very regular basis.
