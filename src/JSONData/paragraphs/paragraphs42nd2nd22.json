","index":"00059","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So let me begin, Madam Speaker, by stating that this is a prima\nfacie case of privilege because the government has failed to call the Standing\nCommittee on Crown Corporations for consideration of Manitoba Hydro's annual\nreports. This is deeply concerning because there are urgent matters that must\nbe discussed regarding Manitoba Hydro, and it is impeding on our ability to\nadequately fulfill my responsibility to my constituents and to ensure proper\nmanagement of the Crown corporation.","index":"00060","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The Crown Corporations Governance and Accountability Act, which\noversees all Crown corporations to ensure continuity and accountability in all\nour beloved Crown agencies states the following: that when an annual report of\na corporation is laid before the Legislative Assembly�that is section&nbsp;10(2)\nTabling reports in the Assembly: that the responsible minister must table a\ncopy of each annual report referred to in subsection (1) in the Assembly within\n15 days after receiving, if the Assembly is sitting, or if not, within 15 days\nafter the next sitting begins.

All\nof&nbsp;&nbsp;these sources point in the direction of a similar conclusion: in\norder to sustain a claim of parliamentary privilege, the Assembly or member\nseeking its immunity must show that the sphere of activity for which privilege\nis claimed is so closely and directly connected with the fulfillment by the\nAssembly or its members of their functions as a legislative and deliberative\nbody, including the Assembly's work in holding the government to account. That\noutside interference would undermine the level of autonomy required to enable\nthe Assembly and its members to do their work with dignity and efficiency.
