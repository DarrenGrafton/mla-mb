I&nbsp; won't take too, too long tonight. I once again want to\nthank the committee. I want to thank the clerks and the legislative staff for\nensuring that we continue to have these public presentations on legislation. I\nthink it's really important.

You talked a little bit about the part that\ndeals with the farm credit and stuff. What are your concerns specifically with\nthose particular sections of&nbsp; this bill that touches so many different\npieces of legislation? ","index":"00070","speaker":"Tom Lindsey"},{"html":"<b>Mr.\nBeddome:</b> Sure. And I wish I can focus on all the&nbsp; legislations, but\nit's the one that�it's what most stood out to me. Firstly, removing the\nManitoba Farm Industry Board that assists in helping mediate farm disputes with\ncreditors. I think that's valuable, having a mediator that's paid for by the\npublic that's involved in trying to deal with those disputes can all�help them\nsell them and help ensure that family farms survive.","index":"00071","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Similarly,\nnow creditors are no longer going to require leave of the Manitoba Farm Industry\nBoard to repossess farm equipment. I mean, I think we need to think carefully\nabout this because that could be some�one's livelihood. If they don't have the\nequipment to plant that crop, if they don't have the equipment to get the hay\noff the fields, that can mean the farm in its&nbsp; entirety. And, obviously,\nanyone that's facing such a creditor proceeding in terms of that is obviously\nprobably not in the strongest financial position to start with. ","index":"00072","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nit's surprising to me that when I think of how many MLAs come from southern\nManitoba and are�an agrarian belt, that this government doesn't realize that.\nMaybe they just don't care about family farmers.","index":"00073","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Hon.\nKelvin Goertzen (Minister of Legislative and Public Affairs):</b> Thank you,\nMr. Beddome, for pre�senting this evening and in the past. I won't get into too\nmuch about the comment you had about family farms. You will know the long\nhistory of this govern�ment and its support for family farms, and we'll let\nthat stand on its own.","index":"00074","speaker":"Kelvin Goertzen"},{"html":"����� I do\nwant to speak, though, a little bit to your comments about committees\nthemselves, and I agree with you. It is one of the great sacred things of the\nManitoba Legislature that we have public pres�entations after second reading,\none of only two provinces, as you mentioned. I'm glad to see that this year,\nspring legislation was made public much earlier than it normally is. Often, the\nLegislature didn't resume sitting 'til April, sometimes as late as May, and\nthen legislation would be seen. This is, I think, is a much better process.","index":"00075","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But I\ntake your point to heart about two weeks notice and while that might be\ndifficult in sort of the legislative calendar perspective, I mean, this piece\nof legislation has been known to�and distributed to the public for more than\ntwo weeks. Maybe it's about ensuring that the public knows the legislation is\nout there, knowing that the committee hearings are going to happen at some\npoint; whether it's in, you know, two weeks or whether it's in two months, it's\ncoming. And at that initial point, doing a better job of ensuring that people\nunderstand that that legislation's available on the website, that's it's out\nthere for public discourse and that a committee hearing will be coming at some\npoint. So there is that time to make those presen�tations.","index":"00076","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I\nthink your point is worth considering and valid from that perspective about\ndoing a better job of&nbsp;&nbsp;ensuring that we can advise the public when\nthere's&nbsp;legislation for consideration, knowing that this process is going\nto come at some point.","index":"00077","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nthank you for that. ","index":"00078","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Mr.\nBeddome:</b> I thank the member for his comments. Certainly, I recognize many\nConservative members of the Legislature are�do have connections to family farm,\nbut I still wonder why you inserted this into the legislation. ","index":"00079","speaker":""},{"html":"����� With\nrespect to your comment about the two weeks, I'll note this is something I've\nasked from the previous NDP government. I recognize there's some scheduling\nchallenges, but I think the Legislature should be able to figure out those\nscheduling chal�lenges. Obviously, when we appear in person we have sometimes\nout-of-town presenters, but even tonight, we're presuming that the public, with\nless than a day's notice, can rearrange their schedule and have their speaking\nnotes put together for this Legislature. ","index":"00080","speaker":""},{"html":"����� What\nwe should aim for is giving every member of the public two weeks notice, and\nyou know what they're going to do? They're going to give you better\npresentations. I would've given you a better presen�tation tonight, and I think\nthat's an important part of the process because I think it's incumbent on\nmembers of the Legislature to hear from the public, to reflect on those and\nhopefully make some good amendments as a result. And, you know, that does\nhappen from time to time. ","index":"00081","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Mr.\nDougald Lamont (St. Boniface):</b> Thank you very much, Mr. Beddome. Yes, and\nI�you�it's a very perceptive comment you've made.

So we strive for&nbsp; continuous improvement to deliver\nvalue to our members and our clients, across the system. ","index":"00094","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We\nexpect the same from government that we, as a private organization, we expect\nit for ourselves. So we have no issue with efforts to find efficiencies and to\nstreamline service delivery as Reducing Red Tape and Improving Services Act,\nBill 55, intends to do. We, in fact, encourage it. ","index":"00095","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Having\nsaid that, we do have some concerns that are founded on fact and information\nwe'd like to share with you today. ","index":"00096","speaker":""},{"html":"����� When\nthese initiatives lead to unintended adverse consequences, I think it should\ngarner all of our attention and capture all of our attention. And those\nunintended consequences are thus: where there are corollary downstream impacts\nthat are unintended and unrealized at the time that legislation is\ncontemplated. Similarly, if there is a misapprehension or misunder�standing of\nwhat the actual benefits of a particular piece of regulation or act have been,\nover time.","index":"00097","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nBill 55 includes the repeal of The Apprenticeship Employment Opportunities Act,\nand if this act is repealed there will be unintended con�sequences for\nManitobans. And before I give you some specifics on that, let me just ask you\nto consider this for a moment: so apprentices are trained through employment�20\nper cent of an apprentice's learning happens in the classroom and 80 per cent happens\nin the workplace. ","index":"00098","speaker":""},{"html":"����� If\napprentices do not work, they cannot complete their education which, in this\ncase, would yield journeyed status in their chosen skill trade. ","index":"00099","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Most\nof Canada's apprentices get their work ex�peri�ence on larger projects; that's\njust a fact. Small employers typically cannot support an apprenticeship. They\ndon't have the numbers and they don't have the work volume to do so. ","index":"00100","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nlarger projects have the capacity and those are the ones that create\nopportunities for apprentices Canada-wide. That's just not a Manitoba syndrome;\nthat applies everywhere. ","index":"00101","speaker":""},{"html":"����� This act, the apprenticeship\nopportunities�employment opportunities act, created opportunities for\napprentices to work on public projects which, by definition, tend to be larger\nprojects, an ideal for en�gaging apprentices. ","index":"00102","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Since\n2018, and I cite Build Force data from 2018-2019 and now 2020-21, that Manitoba\nis winding down a number of large institutional and govern�ment projects, and\nit is well projected, and since 2018 we've been sounding the alarm, about\ndiminishing opportunities in Manitoba to train ap�pren�tices. Opportunities are\ndrying up. ","index":"00103","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, in\nMarch 2021, the government�this govern�ment�increased apprenticeship ratios one\nto one to two to one across the board. This means that we will now have twice\nas many apprentices looking for work, and currently, through the repeal of this\nact, as the ratio changes to create more apprentices, Bill 55 will&nbsp;\neliminate work and training opportunities for these&nbsp; apprentices. That's\ncounter-intuitive and you increase the number of people looking for work, while\nreducing the opportunities they have to go to work. ","index":"00104","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nimpacts of these changes will be exponential impact. It won't be marginal; it\nwill be exponential. As the system creates more apprentices, there will be\nfewer jobs. ","index":"00105","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So we\nnote that the apprenticeship opportunities act does not create any undue\nregulatory burdens, so it is couched in a bill that is intended to reduce red\ntape and increase efficiency, but to our knowledge there has really been no\nissue with this bill. And I say this in jest, but in the existing act,\napprenticeship oppor�tunities act, there are enough loopholes to drive aircraft\ncarriers through. It was only intended to create a circumstance where it\nrequired that, when ap�propriate and feasible, contractors in Manitoba�and not\nonly Manitoba contractors, those wanting to do business in Manitoba�had to\ndemonstrate a com�mitment to apprenticeship. They could seek all kinds of\nexemptions and exceptions but if they were any employer of any size and they\nought to be supporting apprenticeship in Manitoba, they had to do so.","index":"00106","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Simply\nput, that is a good deal for Manitoba and quite frankly, we submit that if that\nis red tape, let's have some more of it. Manitoba tax dollars and Manitoba\npublic works, supporting Manitobans in employ�ment, training and education and\nworkforce development; that can't be considered red tape. It ought not to be.","index":"00107","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So we\nwere certain that was not your intent. Look, there are unintended consequences\nassociated with legislation from time to time.

I'm a professor emeritus at the University of Winnipeg,\nrecently retired, and for the past 25&nbsp; years, I've worked in low-income\ncommunities in Winnipeg, with many community groups and par�ticularly on\nmatters relating to adult education and adult literacy.","index":"00138","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And,\nfor that reason, I want to say that I believe that repealing The Adult Literacy\nAct is a mistake. Some have said, well, Manitoba is the only province in the\ncountry that has an adult literacy act and so we should repeal that act so that\nwe're on a level playing field with the rest of the country.

Why does that matter?","index":"00140","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Well,\na lack of literacy leads to poverty. Poverty produces poor educational\noutcomes. Where there is poverty, people do poorly in school; children and\nyoung people do poorly in school. There have been hundreds of scholarly\narticles on the relationship between poverty and educational outcomes done over\ndecades, done in many countries in the world. They all confirm high levels of\npoverty produce low educational outcomes. We have done studies like that here\nin Manitoba. The Manitoba Centre for Health Policy, affiliated with the faculty\nof medicine at the University of Manitoba, has done such studies repeatedly and\nthat is what they find as well. High poverty areas, low educational outcomes.","index":"00141","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nfor example, the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy studies find that in the\nhighest income quintile in Winnipeg, 98 per cent of young people graduate high\nschool on time.

What we find there is the same\nas what is found every single time. Those neighbourhoods where poverty is high\nare the neighbourhoods where a high proportion of children are not ready for\nschool at age five.

The latest data that I've seen says that\nabout 285,000 adults in Manitoba have literacy levels at level 1 or 2, when\nlevel 3 is what is required for full participation in the economy, in this\nsociety.

I don't know what the\nreason for this is but it's bank economists, economists working for the\nchartered banks in particular, who have spoken to this issue and they have\nfound that two thirds of those people on social assistance have poor literacy\nskills.

This commitment to abolishing\nilliterate Manitobans' ease of access to effective and meaningful re-education\nis a part of the cyclical perpetuation of the violence of poverty that has been\ndisgracing our province and our citizens. By this I mean illiteracy in\nchildhood is caused by poverty and poverty in adulthood is caused by\nilliteracy.

","index":"00492","speaker":"Kelvin Goertzen"},{"html":"����� And I\nthink the member opposite, that while he may not agree with this�and that's\nfine; it's a demo�cratic process, he needn't agree�but he should agree that the\nact wasn't functioning the way it should.
