And I'm very&nbsp; concerned about that because\nwhile there are some&nbsp; vulnerable people that it's certainly clear that it\nwould not be required, the legislation does not limit itself just to vulnerable\npeople and it would apply to all of us in the room. And if a person was not\naware, not informed, not invited to hear, they can have rights taken away from\nthem, property taken away from them, without being informed until after the\nfact. ","index":"00055","speaker":""},{"html":"����� One of\nthe purposes of the hearing, when they have hearings, is to confirm that the\nvulnerable person has received notice. Without having a hearing, the responsibility\nfor that starts and ends with one social worker, who may choose to do what they\nwish. And if someone has not received notice, that social worker is&nbsp; in a\nvery powerful position. Without there being a hearing, without�to ask the\nsocial worker, the com�plete safety of the individuals is lost.

The�it also educates the SDM�substitute decision-maker�that\nthey have responsibilities both for care of the vulnerable person, and that\nthey have to report to the vulnerable person's office with a financial report,\nat least yearly. There is a chance that people can learn some of their\nresponsibilities that way.

I do want to speak to the proposed\namendment to the current vulnerable persons legislation.

","index":"00088","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I have\nhad the experience of meeting hundreds of vulnerable people in Manitoba and\ntheir families. So we would like you all to consider, you know, some really\nimportant points. The hearing panels are really important for watching the\ninteractions of vulnerable people and their proposed decision makers. This\nlegislation was created to protect the most vulnerable citizens in Manitoba.\nAnd they are often people that are non-verbal who cannot speak for themselves,\nand they really do deserve the process of, you know, an objective panel to vet\ntheir proposed decision makers. ","index":"00089","speaker":""},{"html":"����� You\nknow, it's�even for loving families where the vulnerable person has lived in\nthe home their entire lives, you know, on paper, families can look really good\nwith no objections to it. But let's face it, nobody knows what's going on in\nsomebody else's home, okay? And I think our most vulnerable, that are\nnon-verbal, really deserve, you know, that extra look into what's going on. ","index":"00090","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(18:20) ","index":"00091","speaker":""},{"html":"����� During\nthe hearing panels, a lot of education takes place. Right now, the law states\nin Manitoba that no rights will be taken away from anyone in Manitoba unless\nit's absolutely necessary, now or in the fore�seeable future. So I'd like to\nsay that, you know, many proposed substitute decision-makers really don't under�stand\nand they're applying for all kinds of, you know, decision-making rights that\naren't necessarily, you know, needed right at the time. And the hearing-panel\nprocess is definitely that oppor�tunity for them to get some education as to\nwhich powers under personal care should be, you know, appointed to them and\nwhich powers under property.","index":"00092","speaker":""},{"html":"����� You\nknow, we've been pursuing this for some time since we've become aware of the\nproposed amend�ments to the vulnerable persons act, and we've been told on many\nof occasions that community-service workers would have the opportunity to send\nwhat we're calling a straight-forward, maybe no-objection application to a\nhearing panel, or families could have that opportunity. ","index":"00093","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And I\ndo think it's really important to note that, you know, in the community-service\nworkers' area, these folks�many of them are trying to do the best they can, but\nthey are�have heavy, heavy caseloads. And it's really hard for many\nhearing-panel members to imagine that they're going to be looking for extra\nwork, you know asking it to go to a hearing panel. ","index":"00094","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In my\nexperience, which is quite, quite vast in this area, you know, many\ncommunity-service workers don't even read the file before the hearing and they\nvery often are only meeting the vulnerable person for the first time at the\nhearing panel. And family mem�bers, you know, asking them to, you know, suggest\nto go to a hearing panel, I can tell you from first-hand experience: we're\nexhausted. And you know, a lot of vulnerable people, they're up all night; they\nrequire 24-7 care; and looking for something that we might perceive as another\nadded stress is not something that we want to happen.� ","index":"00095","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nI�it's important to know that, so many times, by the end of the hearing panel,\nby the end of the hearing, the proposed substitute decision-makers say, I\ndidn't understand before, but now I do understand.","index":"00096","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In\nclosing, in my experience as a mother and a member of the hearing-panel roster,\nI'd like to leave you all to think about this: if it was your adult child or&nbsp;\nsomeone you loved, would you want only one person to decide where your\ndecision-making rights are going&nbsp; to go, without the proper vetting of\ninfor�mation-gathering of the proposed decision-makers? ","index":"00097","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nagain, you know, we're hearing it's not about saving the government money; but\nwhatever the reasons are for proposing this particular change to the VPA, is it\nreally in the best interest of vulnerable people in Manitoba? We don't believe\nthat only one person should make a decision who will be a decision-maker off a\nwritten application. This is an extremely important proposal to these\namendments that you'll all be voting on, and we are asking you all to really\nthink about this very very seriously.

I will start with an example\nexists in the current FIPPA act. Under the current legislation, if a public\nbody decides that an applicant must pay fees for a request, they issue an\nestimate of cost to the applicant. This is generally put into the mail and then\ntakes some time to reach the applicant. Once received, the applicant has 30 days\nto get payment to the public body.

Such calls are also a great way to demonstrate to applicants that the\npublic body is sincerely attempting to fulfill their duty&nbsp; to assist. It's\nour fear that any new mechanism for stopping the clock could be misused by\npublic bodies seeking to further delay issuing responses to applicants. ","index":"00174","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In\naddition to the changes put forth in this legislation that will lengthen the\nresponse time for applicants to receive information, there are changes to\nsection 13 and the addition of section 13(1.1) which will broaden the grounds\nunder which the public body can disregard requests. Section 13(1) includes new\nlanguage allowing public bodies to disregard requests that, quote, amount to an\nabuse of the right to make a request, end quote, which can rest on a number of\ngrounds now including the public body deems the request to be, quote, need�not\nneed in good faith.

The language contained\nin 29.1, regarding the right to refuse requests that could, quote, reasonably\nbe expected to�harm the competitive position or interfere with contractual or\nother nego�tiations of the public body as an employer, end quote, is very\nconcerning.

The AMM welcomes provisions\nthat extend time for responding to access requests to 45 days from 30 days as\nwell as the period for extensions permitted under the Act to 45 days. The AMM\nalso supports Section 13(1) which grants authority to the head of a public body\n(i.e., municipal administrator) to disregard certain requests under particular\ncircumstances�this provision should help municipalities manage ex�cessive\nrequests. While we appreciate that muni�cipal administrators will be granted\ngreater authority to make these decisions based on their dis�cretion, it is\nvital that this section be further clarified so that all administrators are\nable to exercise this right in confidence.
