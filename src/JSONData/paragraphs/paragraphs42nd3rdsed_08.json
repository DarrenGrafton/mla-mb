","index":"00040","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nbefore I start, I'd like to invite everyone to take a deep breath, to\nacknowledge all the breaths that have been taken away this year. We are still\nsurviving a global pandemic and the reality of it is still weighting on all of\nus: students, children, youth, adults, people in positions of power, people in\npositions of governance and people who have the authority of passing the bill\nalso. We also have�we're all in this together, right?

I was raised in\nQuebec. And I've heard a lot about talking about how the tuition fees�we have\nthe lowest tuition fees west of Quebec here in Manitoba. But I haven't heard\nabout the barriers. And a reality for me in the barriers is I had to move two\nprovinces away to find an education system that would allow me to learn and to\ngrow, and that would allow me to resonate with my values and to choose a path\nthat would help me belong. ","index":"00042","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And I\nchose Winnipeg because Winnipeg seemed to have the most to offer,\ncommunity-wise and also initiative-wise. I made the decision in 2015 at the end\nof the Truth and Reconciliation Commission release, and I was really encouraged\nby all the initiatives that were community-led and activist-led and also\nuniversity-led. Let's point out that the University of Winnipeg was one of two\nfirst universities in this country to make mandatory the�a mandatory require�ment\nfor an Indigenous course for their students, which is making it easier for me\nto feel like I belong in the university, where people are not taught that my\npast is shameful, that my past doesn't exist, that the legacy of my family is\nnot something that's invisible anymore in the University of Winnipeg. And\nthat's a really important cultural shift that has been taking place since 2015\nin the University of Winnipeg.","index":"00043","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Other\nchange that has come my way since I moved here is that as soon as I moved here\nand I started my educational pathways, I've understood that barriers were being\nbuilt, barriers that I've been trying to escape, barriers that are impacting\nthe most vulnerable and marginalized communities. They're not impacting the\nchildren of our governance because our governance are privileged enough to be\nin those seats right now today and make those decisions. They're impacting the\nchildren of people that have been struggling to free themselves from the\noppression of a settler-colonial system that we are all part of. And as me,\nmyself being here, I am forced, still, to place myself in harm's way in front\nof you. ","index":"00044","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I want\nto talk about the fear of students, because the barriers have been stronger\nthis year, a lot stronger, and the fear has been present.

","index":"00045","speaker":""},{"html":"����� This\nyear, I was in front of the Legislative Building in November when we had a tipi\nraised to protest when the government made the decision to remove over\n$300&nbsp;million that belonged to Indigenous children in care. Were they not\nvulnerable enough to have access to an education? Like, how do you think\nstudents�Indigenous students feel when they saw that decision coming from this\ngovernment? How do you think they believe that their children after them, their\nnieces and nephews, the youth that are carrying them, their families and\nrelatives that are struggling to take themselves out of the legacy of\ncolonization, feel? We won't�they won't�they'll have even more barriers to\naccess education than the ones that are currently in university, and that's\nshameful.

Mental health has been a big\nbuzzword this year and it's been important even before the pandemic, but now\nwe're all in the same boat.","index":"00048","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Your\ngovernment has passed a policy that allowed the option to <i>[inaudible]</i>\neasy when people who struggle with mental health don't see the end. That's also\nput a stress on student and a fear on students. What happen if one of their\ncomrades has a crisis and this is an option that's not offered and available?\nWhat happen when you have youth that are struggling and fighting and trying to\nheal from suicidal ideas, having this offered as an other alternative by your\ngovernment? How do you think this is not building up the fear of students?","index":"00049","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I want\nto talk about students in education. Our students in education have heard in\nthe past week your minister, your Premier (Mr. Pallister), said that once they\ngraduate they'll have to pay out of pocket the supplies of their careers. How\nare they not to be afraid once they're going to graduate? ","index":"00050","speaker":""},{"html":"����� What\nthis bill is doing, this bill is giving responsibility to the government to\ndirect the university. It's giving�it's removing the responsibility from the\npeople, from the community and from the communities of support that built those\nuniversities, and it's giving it to your provincial government. ","index":"00051","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Are\nyou planning on being responsible with our education, because you haven't been\nresponsible with the pandemic crisis and we've had to deal with that.

When is your government going to be able to look at\nthe reality and address it?","index":"00052","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We're\nhearing a lot about Bill 33 and how it's going to be better for students, but\nwe wanted you to do something that's better for students before you promise\nthose and you pass those as law because they don't�when I read that document, I\nhad a sense of dread.

You want to build labour. You want\nto align in university in education with the market demands, but there's\nsomething you forget. It's about children. It's about dreams. It's about\nbuilding a new world and a future world. It's about the leaders of tomorrow. As\nyesterday, you were the student, and tomorrow�the students of tomorrow are\nscared. They don't have institutions where they can depend themselves because\nthey can't access those institutions right now. They have to wear a mask\neverywhere they go. And it's quite intriguing to see the privilege and the\nfreedom to which this committee has been not wearing masks while we see you in\nyour institution. This is not a privilege that students have been having this\nyear at all. ","index":"00054","speaker":""},{"html":"����� What I\nwant to see is action from this government to answer to the students' fears\nrather than add to the stress and to the anxiety and the inconsistency of this\ngovernment and responsible answer to the pandemic.","index":"00055","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I want\nto see you do real concrete action. And it seems that the only concrete action\nyou've pushed us to the wall to do�today is to scrap that bill and tell\nstudents that you'll start listening to them and not force them to come at your\ntable to just have a chance to be heard, because that's not responsible. We\nshould be studying right now. We should be focused on saving our education, not\nin saving it from you. ","index":"00056","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I'm going\nto end my presentation here, but I would like to invite other committee\nmembers�I would like to ask me questions. Just be mindful of the space that you\ntake; we don't need to hear your life story; we're still�we're so busy\nstruggling and making sure ours is still possible.","index":"00057","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Thank\nyou.

I think that'll be the\nnext set of questions that the opposition critic will eventually start to talk\nabout. I think it's a great strategy. And it's about attracting people to\nManitoba, because I know that once you get here, and if you can, you know, get\nthrough a hard winter and a summer with a few mosquitoes, you're going to fall\nin love with the place, and you're going to want to, you know, live out your\nlife here, so, with that, thank you very much for your presentation and I look\nforward to meeting you and�in person, possibly�in the future, possibly and\nhaving a conversation.

And also, just\nbe truthful on this that I won't be able to tell the Quebecers to come here,\nbecause this�the options that were there before that invited me here, are not\npresent anymore with this government. I'll have to tell them that if they want\nto come here with this current government, they'll have to put a cap on their\ndream, and that's not okay.","index":"00065","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I also\nwant to acknowledge that the minister has pointed out that I am the University\nof Winnipeg Students' Association's out-going president.

","index":"00069","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I\nthink Bill 33 doesn't even scratch the surface when it comes to dealing with\nthose barriers. And you know, I do hope that at some point the government\nbrings forward and works with groups�students like yourself, and groups to come\ntogether and put forward legislation that will actually help improve the\nbarriers and remove some of the barriers that you and so many students are\nfacing. ","index":"00070","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I just\nwant to get from your experience in�and the students that you deal with and\nwork with�what is, you know, maybe the top one or two specific barriers you\nwish the government would address in the legislation?

I want the\nminister to look at freeing education services for students that need it the\nmost, and at stopping creating barriers with this bill.

It's just a coincidence�my father was actually born and raised in\nManitoba, although I didn't know him well, since he died when I was quite\nyoung. ","index":"00077","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I'd\nlike to think that the minister and probably everybody here has the best\ninterests of students at heart, but we probably disagree with respect to how\nBill 33�or, whether Bill 33 is going to help. Personally, I think that the\nadvice that the minister and the government's been receiving from organizations\nlike KPMG are misguided ones and I'll try to explain why, briefly. ","index":"00078","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(18:20)","index":"00079","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Oh, I\nshould mention I did submit a written document, and, hopefully, that'll find\nits way to the committee in time. ","index":"00080","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Okay,\nso I think a main focus of discussion has been what is the purpose of Bill 33,\nand you cannot discern that, I think, from the document itself. So I've gone\nand looked at some of the other many documents that have been produced relevant\nto post-secondary education under this government, and I'll just share a couple\nof the quotes that I've selected. ","index":"00081","speaker":""},{"html":"����� It is\nexpected that Manitoba's post-secondary institutions will become more agile and\ncontinuously make changes to their systems in order to be more responsive to\nthe pace of labour market changes. ","index":"00082","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Or,\nfrom a letter to the University of Manitoba: Access to this funding will\nrequire your institution to submit a plan that articulates how this funding\nwill be used to orient programs toward labour market needs. ","index":"00083","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I\nthink this bill is clearly part and parcel of that larger agenda and it\nprovides the government with the power to allocate funding in ways that steer\nstudents into certain programs. ","index":"00084","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And I\nthink it's important to emphasize that the trust is not just in the minister,\nbut it has to be in this government, as the former speaker mentioned. It'll be\nat the Cabinet table that this decision will be made under the guidance of\nPremier Pallister and with input from departments that do not have the best\ninterests of students at heart. So the voice of the minister will only be one\nof those voices. ","index":"00085","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I\nlooked at the KPMG report, and if you go to page 13 of the report, which is the\nonly page, I think, the report actually needed, you'll see lots of statistics\nthat demonstrate just how effective the current system is. ","index":"00086","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So it\ngave you some idea: 24- to 34-year-olds in the province are 11 per cent more\nlikely to participate in the labour force than high school graduates, and\nthat's compared to about half that, 6 and 7 per cent for colleges and the\ntrades. ","index":"00087","speaker":""},{"html":"The annual salaries: the premium for high school graduates was over\n$11,000 for universities, about $5,000 for colleges and about almost $6,000 for\ntrades. ","index":"00088","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Employment\nrates three years after graduation are&nbsp;&nbsp;94 per cent for universities\nand 92 per cent for colleges. ","index":"00089","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I'm\nnot exactly sure what the problem is on the student and education side that it\nrequires this particular bill or the intervention of the Pallister government\ninto internal operations of autonomous institutions. ","index":"00090","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I\nshould mention that there's many, many statistics that would confirm this. And,\nwith all due respect to the minister, he's appealed several times to the\nAuditor General's report. The Auditor General did not seem to be aware that\nthere is a huge amount of data available about the general benefits of\npost-secondary education, including specific programs and including information\nthat's particular to Manitoba. ","index":"00091","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nit's not out�as though there is some vacuum out there that needs to be filled,\npresumably by an expensive apparatus that will have to do the job that Stats\nCanada is already doing.","index":"00092","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Why\nKPMG went on and added many more pages is clearly because they had to focus on\ncosts, completely ignoring the benefits that they could have easily calculated,\nI would imagine. You can take these salary differentials and figure out how\nmuch more taxes university graduates pay than they would have paid if they were\nhigh school graduates. You could go through and figure out from employment\nstatistics how much fewer social services were required throughout the life\nwork�the working life of univer�sity graduates and well into retirement. ","index":"00093","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So the\ncurrent system is working, I think, on balance. It probably more than pays for\nitself when you take a long-term perspective, which systems like a\npost-secondary system do take, as opposed to perhaps a shorter term\nperspective. ","index":"00094","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nwhy does it work? It works because employ�ment decisions are complicated. It's\nnot just a matter of how much money one's going to earn, it also depends on the\naptitudes and interests of students. The minister, at the last meeting,\nreferred to sitting around the table with his kids and talking about education,\nwhere decisions should be made. And they shouldn't be overly influenced by a\nminister, you know, on Broadway street, who has decided that he wants�or she or\nthey�want to influence students in ways towards certain occupations. ","index":"00095","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I\ndon't think even employers benefit from students who are doing things because\nof the money. Employers want students who are interested and invested in their\noccupations, not people who are just there to take a paycheque and go home at\nwhatever the hour is and put the job out of their minds.","index":"00096","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\ncurrent system is also successful because students follow many diverse paths to\nemployment. A lot of them, probably about 20 or 30 per cent, will actually go\non to further education in professional and graduate programs. So the outcome\nfor these students won't even be known for years into the future. ","index":"00097","speaker":""},{"html":"In my own case, I had four years of undergraduate and six years of Ph.D.\nHow could the University of Western Ontario or the government in Ontario have\nmonitored the effectiveness of the path that I had chosen? ","index":"00098","speaker":""},{"html":"A third reason that things work is because many of the competencies that\nuniversities help students develop are, in fact, generic ones. That's why they\ncan go into so many occupations. And, again, look closely at page 13 of the\nKPMG report. University graduates in Manitoba score higher on literacy and\nnumeracy than do college graduates, and they're higher than university\ngraduates in Ontario and the other Western provinces. ","index":"00099","speaker":""},{"html":"I know we have difficulties here with achieve�ment in education but it's\nnot a problem with the K‑to‑12 system that Minister Ewasko worked\nin, and it's not the problem of the system that I work in at universities. The\nproblems are more fundamental than that and have to do with students who are\nsimply unable to benefit from those systems for a variety of reasons.","index":"00100","speaker":""},{"html":"Another theme that emerges from a lot of these documents is the need to\nadapt to workplace change in the future. Of course, universities are a large\npart of what those changes are going to be, both directly and indirectly, in\nterms of educating the entrepreneurs of the future, for example.","index":"00101","speaker":""},{"html":"More directly, universities have already shown themselves as able to\nadapt to dramatic changes in society. Society has moved from an\nagricultural-based system, to a manufacturing system, to a service-based system\nand to who knows what in the future. ","index":"00102","speaker":""},{"html":"Throughout this whole process, universities have expanded in their\ncontribution to society and in a highly successful way, as I mentioned just a\nmoment ago. ","index":"00103","speaker":""},{"html":"Just to give you some idea of the magnitude of the change: Between 1992\nand 2018 in Canada, the number of university graduates went from 169,000 to\n318,000, an increase of 150,000 or so.

I think, respectfully, I would respond to a few things.\nThe bursaries being wrapped into an easier package is great, but it is much\neasier for young students to look at the sticker price of education and see\nthat it's not for them, rather than dig deep and see that there are, in fact,\noptions available to them. So I would encourage you that those bursaries, while\nthey're great, don't match the kind of accessibility as a lower cost of tuition\nwould.","index":"00432","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I\nthink, also, as for people moving to this province, I didn't look at the tax\nrate when I moved to Manitoba, which I think a lot of other professionals\nreally aren't looking at that kind of thing. They're looking at whether there\nare the kinds of services and amenities and solid education systems for their\nchildren.

I know\nit's late and you've been doing this for two days.","index":"00447","speaker":""},{"html":"����� My\nname is Dr. Joe Curnow. I am a faculty member at the University of Manitoba. I\nteach in the department of education. And so I�you've heard so many compelling\narguments from so many people who are telling you that this bill is a mistake,\nand so I'm going to try not to relitigate those because they've been, I think,\nfar more eloquent than I will be. But I want to stress a few things from my\nexpertise and from my perspective.","index":"00448","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nfirst, as an educational researcher, I want to say that this bill will not\nachieve equity outcomes. I teach equity in schools to teacher candidates in the\nfaculty of ed, and what the research shows is very similar to what students\nhave already come before you and said again and again: this bill will not\nadvance equity. ","index":"00449","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We\nknow that for a number of reasons. You've already talked extensively about debt\nand the way that debt deters students, both because of the very real perceived\nbarriers to accessing bursaries and the ways that people, for different\nreasons, will look at the kinds of costs that are associated with this and the\nrising tuition in Manitoba over the last years and say, like, this isn't for\nme, this isn't an investment that I can make. ","index":"00450","speaker":""},{"html":"And I think that that is a real and serious concern that we need to\nthink about. Who are we serving with this legislation? And I don't think\nstudents are it, and certainly not Black and Indigenous students, students of\ncolour and disabled students. I'll leave it at that and I'm happy to talk about\nsome of that research if you would like.","index":"00451","speaker":""},{"html":"I also want to speak as a faculty member. As a relatively new, young\nfaculty member, I have real concerns about the way that this bill threatens\nuniversity autonomy. University autonomy has, for a very long time, been a core\ntenet of higher education, and this really threatens that, making the current\ngovernment's wills very easy to impress upon the university and to do lasting\ndamage. It really�this bill really threatens the long-term sustainability of\nthe university.","index":"00452","speaker":""},{"html":"I think that this is a bad direction not only because of the threat to\nacademic freedom but also because it proposes to replace the expertise of the\nfaculty, the vast research capacity that we have, with an appointed board that\nserves�or has at least the risk of really supporting cronyism at its worst and\ndoesn't really serve the interests of the university at its best. ","index":"00453","speaker":""},{"html":"As Dr. Gabbert attested earlier, there are so many bodies in place, from\nthe board of governors to the senate and to others, that take this role really\nseriously of making decisions about the future programs and making sure that\nthey are the highest quality possible and making sure that they are running\nefficiently and effectively.","index":"00454","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And�but\nI also have other questions about how this will impact the university when I\nthink about recruitment. So my faculty and others at U of M have had a hard\ntime recruiting top talent to our university for a lot of reasons, and this is\none of them: I think when junior faculty and young professors and\ngraduating�grad students look at these kinds of threats, it makes them\nreconsider applying to universities in our system.","index":"00455","speaker":""},{"html":"����� People\ncome to U of M despite the support that we have, not because of it, right? So,\nwe do not have competitive salaries. We do not have competitive research\nfunding and support, and that makes it really hard for a young faculty person\nto say yes, like, I want to go to U of M; I can be successful there for a\ncareer and I can partner with the businesses and the communities in Manitoba to\ndo some innovative research.","index":"00456","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We\nreally are missing out on a lot of, like, the most innovative researchers\nbecause we are not adequately investing in our university. In fact, pulling\nresources back more and more and asking faculty members to do more with less\nevery year.","index":"00457","speaker":""},{"html":"����� That\nalso has real financial implications for the University in that we are less\ncompetitive for getting SSHRC and NSERC and CIHR funding. So, this tri-council\nfunding is one of the key ways that the federal government gets funding into\nthe province through education. That's where�how we do training and how we fund\ngraduate students. And when I can't get a course release, that means that I\ncan't do that work competitively.","index":"00458","speaker":""},{"html":"����� That\nalso has repercussions for the kind of innovation that's coming out of our\nuniversities. If I want to do good partnership with community members and with\nindustry, it's increasingly difficult for me to do that because there's not\nadequate support from the provincial government. And that is kind of like a\nspiraling problem where the less resources put in and the less autonomy the\nuniversity has to make decisions about where resources go, the harder it is to\ndo this. And then it spirals iteratively.","index":"00459","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I\nthink this has�this raises real questions from me about the long-term\nsustainability of the university because we want to be doing that innovative\nresearch. That innovative research is what helps the university to increase its\nstatus and its notoriety. It also helps us to, like, make Manitoba competitive,\neconomically and socially. It also is just one of these main engines of growth\nand investment for the province, but it's not treated like that.","index":"00460","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nfinally, I have a lot of concerns about this legislation as a community member.\nThe minister's told Dr. Gabbert earlier that ultimately you are accountable to\nthe taxpayers. And I want to intervene here. I want to say that you are\naccountable to citizens and to the community. And yes, we also pay taxes but\nthat is not our primary role.","index":"00461","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I\nwould like you to think about how investing in higher education and really not\ntrying to, like, exert political control over higher education is a practice of\nbuilding democracy and making sure that the democracy is healthy and that we\nare�that the university is a key tool and a key partner in making sure that\nthe�our democracy can function well and that our society can function well. ","index":"00462","speaker":""},{"html":"And that that is your role, not in only keeping an eye on the\npocketbook. And that is a piece of your role but, like, truly, truly, if all\nyou are interested in is us as taxpayers then we are really doing\nthis�something wrong, because higher education has so much to offer in terms of\nbuilding a robust citizenry where people can care for each other and care about\neach other and think critically.","index":"00463","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nmany of those programs are not the most viable economically perhaps, and that\ndoes not mean that they are not valuable.","index":"00464","speaker":""},{"html":"����� One of\nthe earlier speakers spoke about how the requirement to have an�excuse me, an\nIndigenous studies course was really meaningful to her and yet it is hard to\nquantify how that is financially the most viable thing. That doesn't mean that\nthere's not a responsibility for settlers to be engaging in education around\ntreaty and reconciliation and decolonization.","index":"00465","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so\nI think there's so many things about this legislation that really put the\nhealth and vibrancy of our democracy at risk. They put the health and vibrancy\nof our university at risk. And I really encourage you to just withdraw this\nbill. I don't think it's bringing a lot of value.","index":"00466","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(20:20)","index":"00467","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nI'm happy to speak more about the different research bodies in education that\nspeak to that, but I think that this isn't�this hasn't been an\nevidence-informed process so far. ","index":"00468","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so\nI hope that you will go back to the drawing board. There's ample evidence from\nother institutions, from other states in the US, who've gone through similar\nprocesses and who had it�who've seen legislation like this have devastating\nrepercussions for their institutions and for their states. And I want us to\navoid all of that. ","index":"00469","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nthank you for your time.

","index":"00475","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Ms.\nCurnow:</b> If the goal is affordability and sustainability, then I think that\nthe better strategy is for us to be looking at universal free education. That\nis a program and a policy that has much better outcomes in terms of actually\nmaking sure that people can access university. It makes sure that people don't\nhave to jump through the hoops of applying for�to take on debt that they may or\nmay not be able to ever pay off; applying for bursaries which they may or may\nnot get, and which they often don't know how to get.","index":"00476","speaker":""},{"html":"����� It has\na much better outcome in terms of driving engagement with the university\nand�driving engage�ment with the university, not just for credentialing but for\nactual learning and engagement and participation in community. And we see in\nplaces where there is free education, especially states that have, like, free\neducation for seniors, you see really robust engagement, where people want to\ntake classes and want to participate and want to be bringing what they're\nlearning in the classroom into their work�places, in all of these ways that\nthey wouldn't when they have to pay for it. ","index":"00477","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so\nI am interested in strategies that look at how do we make university free. How\ndo we make university courses more available? And that is also a strategy for\nsustainability, because if you're investing significant resources�which this\nbill does not do and which this government, unfortunately, has not done�into\nuniversity, then I think we see a really different commitment to making the\nuniversity one of the crown jewels of the province. And I've heard you say it\nagain and again that you want to make Manitoba really attractive to people. ","index":"00478","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Having\nuniversal education, K-12 that's deeply invested in, as well as post-secondary,\nis a key stra�tegy for doing that but there hasn't been moves toward that.

","index":"00479","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nso, while I appreciate the lip service, I would like to see actual policy and\nlegislation that reflects those goals of making the university sustainable and\nmaking it affordable and making it so that all of our community members can\nparticipate and can be part of university education in really meaningful ways.

I\nthink that aspect is one maybe�very serious, unintended consequence of Bill 33.\n","index":"00482","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I\nwanted to get your thoughts on those two issues.

So, the equity question's I think very big and I think other\npeople have spoken to it pretty significantly, in terms of how Indigenous\nstudents, in particular, will be impacted and how folks with disabilities will\nbe impacted, and so I'll let that stand. ","index":"00485","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I'm\ngoing to speak to the attracting faculty and innovation. We do so much\npartnership with industry, with community members, with non-profit organi�zations,\nwith for-profit organizations at the university. ","index":"00486","speaker":""},{"html":"And I feel like a lot of this legislation kind of ignores that. It's\nlike, we're going�as the government in power, we're going to make decisions\nabout what is valuable. We're not going to look to what the research says, or\nwhat the expertise of our faculty help us to understand. We're going to decide\nfor them.

Several station alumni have\nmade&nbsp;an impact locally and nationally as broadcasters (Joe&nbsp;Aiello,\nAllan Cross, Andrea Collins, Bradford How) and many more alumni have used what\nthey learned at CKUW to enhance their resume and find employment in other\nfields.
