As you know,\nthis was legislation that enacted�that was enacted by the previous government\nto allow people suffering domestic violence to escape to safety with a\nguarantee of employment, a guarantee to maintain the ability to provide for\ntheir children, to become a survivor. ","index":"00038","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I stood here and told the story of my mother and I, both of us\nvictims of domestic violence. We both chose to flee our abusive relationships,\nwith our children, to a place of safety. For my mother, that was a shelter. We\nbecame survivors.","index":"00039","speaker":""},{"html":"����� However, my mom's story is very different than mine. She ended up\ngetting fired from her job because her employer was not as understanding as\nmine. Her employer gave her an ultimatum: be back to work in two days or you're\nwithout a job. ","index":"00040","speaker":""},{"html":"����� She chose her family. She chose to ensure that six of my nine\nbrothers and sisters that still lived at home with her had all they needed and\nthat she could attend to legal matters and find them a safe place to live. ","index":"00041","speaker":""},{"html":"����� She made the right choice, but that cost her everything: her\ncommunity, her home, her job, her dignity. All this because there were no\nprotections under the law to ensure people like my mother wouldn't have their\nemployment affected by leaving a relationship that was causing harm to them and\ntheir children. ","index":"00042","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I was lucky. My employer did the right thing. She told me to take\nall the time I needed to ensure my kids and I were safe, that we could get our\nlives on a better path and that I could come back to work. My children and I\nwere able to maintain our dignity in our community. My employer ensured we\nbecame survivors, and that's how it should be.

Because of\nthis, there will be more survivors. ","index":"00044","speaker":""},{"html":"����� It means the eligibility now extends beyond domestic abuse to\nvictims of sexual violence and stalking, regardless of whether they know their\nabuser or not. Now these victims, too, will have the benefit to obtain medical,\nlegal and other supports. This will make it easier to become a survivor.

But, given an opportunity to share some ideas and they wouldn't\njust be mine, they would definitely be from fellow survivors and folks that are\nabused today, and not just women but men as well. I've had a number of men have\ncome to me sharing the mental and emotional abuse that they are trying to survive\nat home, so there are many ideas I've got and I would love to put together some\nideas and share, absolutely.
