Once fully implemented, this new\nlegislation will signi�ficantly change how child-welfare services are delivered\nin Manitoba, and it will also change the role of the advocate in looking out\nfor Manitoba's children and youth.

Through this legislation, an\nexpansion and strengthening of our mandate to advocate in additional domains\nbeyond child welfare came into effect. As a result, more children, youth and\nyoung adults call us for help to navigate public systems, including Child and\nFamily Services, disabilities, mental health, addictions, education, youth\njustice and victim support services, which includes domestic violence and\nsexual exploitation.

As mentioned, our annual report\nreveals that last year 55 per cent of&nbsp;&nbsp;these children and youth and\nyoung adults required&nbsp;&nbsp;advocacy in more than one service area, and 15\nper cent were dealing with needs in more than five&nbsp;service areas.

One report is an\ninvestigation into the suicide death of a boy who experienced extreme bullying\nand who lived with profound mental illness. The second report is an aggregated\ninvestigation into 22 girls who died by suicide and whose story clearly\nillustrates the gaps in&nbsp;&nbsp;the current continuum of mental health and\naddiction services in our province. ","index":"00065","speaker":""},{"html":"����� This\nlast year I released four special reports as mentioned, all of which addressed\nmental health and&nbsp;&nbsp;addiction issues, and I made specific recom�mendations\nto improve services for young people in&nbsp;&nbsp;Manitoba.

They are outside of this, so while we'll make recommendations\nto a system where we're analyzing CFS involvement as the primary thing that\ncauses them to come to our attention, needs and indicators could be very\ndifferent for other kids who are ending their life in north and south with\nrespect to mental health issues.

I did think�earlier the children's\nadvocate made it clear in her testimony proclaiming phase 2 and 3 have nothing\nto do with bill C-92, that phase 2 and 3 extends the role of the children's\nadvocate by definition beyond CFS. It would actually allow to cover all who�all\nchildren in Manitoba, whereas bill C-92 is primarily about First Nations\nchildren in care, and as I understand, the entire pace of change under that\nbill be driven by First Nations through negotiation on a case-by-case basis,\nbut there are a thousand children in CFS who are not indigenous who are in the\nsystem.
