","index":"00612","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now, their career paths were very different, as I'm sure it is for\nmany newcomers to Manitoba. My father came here after some stops in\nAmerica�brief stops in America�and chose to come to Winnipeg because he was\naccepted into the faculty of engineering at the University of Manitoba. And\nthat's a notable chose�choice for him because his father was an engineer in\nTrinidad, and so he was following in his father's foot-steps practising\nengineering. ","index":"00613","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And I think that, for him, it was important to go into a career\nlike that, as it was not only what�he had grown up seeing that type of work\ndone, but also knew that it provided a significant amount of value into an\neconomy and to a community. And knowing my father, my dad, he is always a guy\nwho wanted to find ways to give back to community.

Of course the job hunt part of it was a challenge, but when it\ncame to getting his university degree he went through that process.","index":"00615","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now, I think about, fast-forward, you know, some 40, 50 years\ntoday�to�in�a newcomer to Manitoba, the challenges that they face. And I've\nalready heard stories in my, you know, just over a year in my role as MLA, from\ninternational individuals who are in Manitoba now, looking for work in a\nprofession where they've previously worked and hearing the frustration in their\nvoices and knowing if they've had a wonderful career in their home country,\nwhether it be in health care, whether it be in education, whether it be in\nagriculture or a variety�any number of industries, and struggle to find that\nsame level of work here in Manitoba. ","index":"00616","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And it's�and I will also draw attention to the point that many of\nthese people, as they come to Manitoba and to Canada, are often asked, as a\npart of their immigration to Manitoba, what their education is, what their skills\nare, what jobs do they have and what are they going to bring to Canada and to\nManitoba when they get here. ","index":"00617","speaker":""},{"html":"����� That's part of the deal of them coming to Canada. That's part of\nthe arrangement of them choosing to live here.

And it is part of our role to break down those barriers. ","index":"00618","speaker":""},{"html":"����� While Bill 41 takes some steps in that regard, it certainly doesn't\ngo far enough. There are a whole host of challenges and barriers that many\nindividuals will still face, regardless of whether this bill moves forward or\nnot. ","index":"00619","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so, like, you know, my parents' story. As they met here and\nworked here as new immigrants to the country, found their way, you know, had to\nwork many part-time jobs in between until they found that career role, so do\nmany of the immigrants and newcomers to our province face those challenges\ntoday. ","index":"00620","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now they face those challenges of having to pay for their immediate\nneeds, also pay for schooling, maybe care for family that they have here.

I know my parents have done and\ncontinue to do that same thing today. And I know that newcomers to our province\ndo the same thing.","index":"00622","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so, for our minister to say that, you know, a compliance order\nthat he could give if a college is making it too difficult for someone to get a\nlicence, that a compliance order would encourage a college to act differently\nafter multiple times of not following that, doesn't help the person who's\nalready been dis-enfranchised by that college or by that barrier, right.

They don't always have that luxury. Why? Because their�they know\nthe realities of their situation: that they need to have a job.

","index":"00624","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so, for a compliance order that might take several weeks or\nmonths or years to come from a minister's office to then change the action of a\nregulated professional college, to then change their action and remove a\nbarrier, is little solace for an individual who's already lost out, who's already\nbeen stopped, been barred by a barrier�by an unjust barrier.

Could a�is there any person in that, within that professional\nfield, that could contact the minister about a barrier that they've seen with\ngetting licensed?","index":"00636","speaker":""},{"html":"����� It's\nvery subjective, and�in terms of which�what would cause the minister to issue a\ncompliance order to a regulated professional body. And that subjectivity has\nsome concern on my end. And the reason is because we've seen a track record of\nthese types of application of the rules be put in place that advantages one\ncertain group of people and disadvantages another certain group of people. And\nI'm talking about, quite frankly, issues that will affect minority groups in\nour province, minority groups of people who are coming into our country and our\nprovince and looking for opportunities to work.

Because at that time\nwhen it is just a subjective rule, then it can become who has access to the\nminister more gets the�gets more preferential treatment, who has the ability to\nwrite a stronger-worded letter to the minister's office or to the director. ","index":"00638","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nmaybe those sorts of people are ones who are going to be current Manitoban\ncitizens, who have been educated in Manitoba and can voice their opinion. Maybe\nit won't be the person who is a newcomer to Manitoba and doesn't know the\nprocesses and maybe has English as not their first language.

There's so many barriers put in place, whether it be\nspots within a post-secondary institution that they're qualified to get into\nbut the government hasn't funded enough spots for people to actually get into their\npost-secondary institution, whether it be the fact that there's, you know,\ntemporary pauses in programs or changes in programs or hours to work within\nthat profession.

And the minister and\nother members must really grapple with the fact that those barriers may not be\nremoved. And they must work with these colleges and regulators to ensure that\nthose types of barriers which aren't mandatory must be looked at and see how\nthey can be removed to streamline it and, frankly, make it not just easier from\na timeliness standpoint that the minister has tried to address in this bill,\nbut also from a cost standpoint.

And so the minister should strongly consider, you know, adding an\namendment to this legislation or perhaps working directly with colleges to\neliminate some of these cost barriers so that they can truly show that they're\nlooking at the newcomers to Canada's best interests in terms of being able to\nwork in professions here in our province. ","index":"00647","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I�my\nnext point is I'd like to also bring up the relationship between these\nprofessional colleges and our post-secondary institutions. And the minister, in\nthis bill, has said that they should be working more closely, as best they can,\ntogether. But we've already seen this year, and in previous years, the\nreduction in funding for our post-secondary institutions. We've seen it at UCN.\nWe saw that there was a cut to funding there. We saw 1.5 per cent. We saw at\nUniversity of&nbsp;Manitoba, the faculty was asked to reduce by 2.5&nbsp;per\ncent. We know that universities and colleges are being funded less year over\nyear from this government. ","index":"00648","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And,\nwhen asked today in questioning, the minister said that there's no budget item,\nthere's no budget line dedicated for this bill; that there's no specific budget\nitem that will actually fund the creation of a minister's role, the creation of\nstaff for that�sorry, the director role, staff for that director. All the extra\nwork that a college might have to go to to provide additional paperwork to the\nminister or potentially deal with compliance order, and there's no budget line,\nas the minister said just now, to allow more collaboration between the colleges\nand the post-secondary institutions. This is noteworthy because if any\nsignificant change is going to be made to streamline the process between the\nrequirements of a college and the educating post-secondary institution, it's\ngoing to need financial resources. ","index":"00649","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so\nask yourself, if the minister has said there's no budget line for this\nspecifically�if the minister said there's no budget line for this specifically\nand the colleges and the post-secondary institutions are now required to do\nthis in this law, where are they going to get the money from? Where are those\ndollars and cents? Where are those financial resources going to come from? ","index":"00650","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Well,\nI'll tell you where. They're going to come from two places. The colleges have\nmore expenses, they're going to come from the fees that those professionals\npay. So that means you're now taking money out of the pockets of doctors, of\nnurses, of audiologists, of speech-language pathologists. You're taking money\nout of their pocket because the Province hasn't put any�hasn't put a budget\nline for this item, making their lives more difficult for all these regulated\nprofessions. ","index":"00651","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nsecond spot it's going to come from is from post-secondary education for any\nchanges that they have to make at the college at the�for example, Red River\nCollege or the University of Winnipeg or Manitoba from their level. And so what\ndoes that mean? It means that those extra fees and extra cost burdens are going\nto be put on the backs of students. ","index":"00652","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nagain, this is another way for this minister�and it's a trend that we've seen\nacross this government, for them to download the costs of running the\ngovernment onto the backs of everyday Manitobans, that the�on the backs of\nnurses, on the backs of doctors, of other regulated professions, on the backs\nof university and college students who are just trying to start off their\ncareer and get an education and come and add to our economy here. They're going\nto be faced with higher fees, higher tuition because this minister didn't put a\nline item in here to support this bill which should, in theory, be breaking\ndown barriers. ","index":"00653","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nlast point I'll raise in this is the idea that I proposed to the minister in my\nquestioning, the idea of the ombudsman. An ombudsman is a role that can provide\nadvocacy for individuals who have been unfairly treated. It's a role that is,\nyou know, unique and has authority to provide reports on how systems can be\ndone and completed more correctly. And it already exists in Manitoba in many\nareas. Ombuds-man is available for other organizations right now and so it is\ncompletely realistic to see how that role of an ombudsman could be added to our\nregulated colleges, regulated professions, our colleges that are serving our\nprofessional regulations. ","index":"00654","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nthat idea shouldn't just be sat with the director's position, who doesn't have\nan advocacy role&nbsp;&nbsp;on behalf of individuals or doesn't have that\nnecessarily reporting role.

Like\nhas been mentioned, many international-educated individuals who are coming to\nwork in a profession here are not looking for an easier path. People who come\ninto Manitoba are not looking for an easy path. And, as my father can attest,\nhe wasn't looking for an easy handout. He was looking for a fair shot.

","index":"00722","speaker":"Amanda Lathlin"},{"html":"����� Madam Speaker, we know that Manitoba needs well-trained workers and\nwe support efforts to improve qualification recognition, but let's be clear.\nBill 41 introduces some process changes that, on its own, will not address the\nchallenge of timely qualification recognition. ","index":"00723","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Bill 41, Madam Speaker, puts new respon-sibilities onto regulated\nprofessions, allowing the minister to issue regulations and compliance\nonto�orders onto professions with regard to the processing of qualification\nrecognition. ","index":"00724","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But in reviewing this legislation, the question we are asking\nourselves today is this: Why is Bill 41 actually do�will Bill 41 actually do\nwhat the Pallister government says it will do? Namely, I quote, helping\nqualified internationally trained applicants to get working in their\nprofessions. End quote. Faster. Well, just like so much with the Pallister\ngovernment, this�the answer is no, unfortunately. ","index":"00725","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Madam Speaker, Manitoba's not going to solve the challenge of\ncredential recognition by giving the minister a new ability to threaten\nregulated pro-fessions with sanctions. Instead, what is required is a sustained\nfocus and significant new resources, both to recognize, train and co-ordinate\nnew applicants with Manitoba's labour market. ","index":"00726","speaker":""},{"html":"����� However, Bill 41 does one thing for the Pallister government and\nthat is to check off a box on a list at priorities and planning labeled as, Madam\nSpeaker, I quote, election commitments. End quote. The pre-sentation provided\nto us listed in this bill status as an election commitment multiple times. ","index":"00727","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Madam Speaker, what we should be asking ourselves is this: What is\ngoing�what is it going to take to make Manitoba an inviting place to come to\nand when�and what is it going to take to ensure those with qualifications from\nelsewhere get what they need to live to their full potential here in Manitoba? ","index":"00728","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Clear�on this score is failing miserably. On a net basis last year,\nnearly 10,000 people left Manitoba for other provinces. That's the worst net\nout-migration to other provinces in over 30 years. Qualification recognition,\nMadam Speaker, is part of that problem. ","index":"00729","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The real challenge is one of opportunity, though. Under the\nPallister government, more and more young people are finding their future\nopportunities in other provinces and more and more newcomers to this province,\nhaving first come to Manitoba, are now looking elsewhere for their permanent\nCanadian home. As I said, a net interprovincial migration of nearly 10,000\npeople last year. That's the worst such performance of this province.

It requires collaboration and it also requires investment.","index":"00733","speaker":""},{"html":"����� There are also some other changes within the bill which we hope the\nminister will provide further insight at committee and in further reading. For\nexample, Madam Speaker, Bill 41 removes the position of the Fairness\nCommissioner. The depart-ment tells us that this position will be replaced by a\ndirector within the department. After 4 years of consolidation and cuts by the\nPallister government, we really need to see more from the minister to reassure\nus that this change isn't about trying to cut positions and reduce costs. I\nencourage the minister to provide more evidence to this effect.","index":"00734","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And in regards to diversity and our newcomers, Madam Speaker,\nManitoba is a province of diversity.
