I've talked sincerely with the Leader of the\nOpposition and with the second leader of the Liberal Party about doing\ncommittee work together, which I still maintain was some of the most rewarding\nwork that I had the change to do in Ottawa when I was there. When we shed the\nparty stuff�and you never shed it totally, come on, you know�but, you know, you\nput it aside and you can sit at a table and work with people on something of\nshared interest and come together. And when we did that and the Finance\nCommittee, and we worked very hard at it, we came up with some really good\nideas. I'll give the member some examples. ","index":"00027","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The Registered Disability Savings Plan, which is a program that\nallows families who have a disabled family member to set aside some money in\nadvance. Many conditions, many disabilities are ones which cause deterioration\nof quality of life over time, and costs are incurred because of that, you know,\nmaybe a mobility challenge. I had a friend who's dealing with that type of\ncondition now where there's going to have to be a lot of�let's just put it this\nway, there's going to be a lot of costs. You know, modifications to his place\nof residence have to happen, it's expensive stuff. ","index":"00028","speaker":""},{"html":"����� What the registered disability savings plan did is it allowed for\nhis family to set aside a little bit of money on a monthly basis�they did�and\nbenefit by a bit of an incentive initially, and then by the tax sheltering of\nthe money as it grew�didn't have to report every year, so it wasn't eroded by\nthe tax on the growth, right? So their net yield on the savings was much higher\nas a result. ","index":"00029","speaker":""},{"html":"����� This plan, this proposal came forward to our Finance Committee from\na group advocating for the disabled. We debated it, we looked at it as a\ncommittee, we made the recommendation. In this case, it was to the\ndeparted-too-soon Finance Minister Jim Flaherty. It was�a good fellow who died\ntoo young.

We saw yesterday, in\nthe last hour, what happens when you don't take that approach. This creates\nreluctance on my part to use what I've just described as a mechanism to bring\npeople together. It creates reluctance because if a member of our Chamber\nsimply wants to use a venue of committee as an opportunity to make partisan\nattacks on another member, which is what we saw yesterday, then they're going\nto destroy the effectiveness of that type of work; they're going to make it\nnothing more than a political exercise when it should be largely a\nnon-political exercise.

","index":"00043","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And also, in terms of precedence, all governments are allowed to\nbring in legislation regarding fee measures, which they can apply, prior to the\nimplementation and adoption of said legislation. This was done, for example,\nmost recently by the NDP when they jacked up the PST. They brought in\nlegislation to jack up the PST after promising not to, in 2012. It did not\npass. It was delayed significantly, yet it was invoked. On July 1st of that\nyear, the bill itself was delayed as we sat through the summer, as some here\nmight remember, or perhaps, only two members of the committee will\nremember�three, I guess if you�four, if we include you, Mr. Chair.

","index":"00044","speaker":""},{"html":"����� It was invoked on July 1st of 2012, but the bill was not passed\nuntil much later. In fact, even after it was passed, it was challenged in a\ncourt proceeding. The court proceeding was fought over the following year, yet,\neven then, with a questionable legality around the introduction of said bill,\nthe tax was being withdrawn by the NDP government. So there is ample precedent\nfor governments being able to introduce fee measures, or, in the case of my\nexample of the PST tax measures, which come into effect prior to the passage of\nthe bill. ","index":"00045","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In the case of the PST, of course, that meant, annually, about\n$300 million. This one, the member, I think has�is in his possession of Public\nAccounts, documents�yes�so he has the numbers there. It would be fair to say\nthat the purpose behind a social responsibility levy is to�as is similar with\nalcohol�it is to make sure that we have funds available to assist in offsetting\nthe costs created by the distribution and consumption of the commodity. ","index":"00046","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And to some degree�and, of course, we�we're always dealing in a\nposition�we're in a position of uncertainty, because we don't know�we can't\npredict the future with great certainty but we can hope that at some point we\nare better able to measure the degree to which (a) people are purchasing legal\ncannabis and related products and then (b) measuring on an ongoing basis, as we\nwill, what the consequences of the distribution of that product are. So that we\ncan, to some degree, balance out those things and make sure that we're not distributing\nproducts which create a social cost which is not, to some degree at least,\nborne by those who benefit from the sale and distribution of the products. So\nthat's the objective here. ","index":"00047","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Our pricing model is different, different from other provinces and\nother provinces have different models among them as well. But our model is\ndesigned to make sure, as I said, that we are aware of the social\nresponsibility cost, that we measure them and that we place that burden not on\nthe individual but on the companies or those entities who are benefitting from\nthe sale of the product.

And then I guess in that sitting\nwe'll see this bill come back. But, with the timing of that being up in the air\nand I guess, especially the passage of that bill and royal assent to that bill\nbeing unknown at this time, also recognizing, like, I guess, a lot of\nlegislation that&nbsp;gets brought in doesn't pass until next year, 2020, I'm\nwondering if we could just revisit the Premier's (Mr. Pallister) rationale\nthere about being able to put in place a revenue measure like this even before\nit has statutory authority. ","index":"00050","speaker":""},{"html":"I guess what I'm wondering about speci�fically�just\nasking the First Minister to clarify here�can�does that same logic apply even\nif the statutory authority comes in a different fiscal year? Because it seems\nlike that might be an open question because it seems as though the fees being\ncollected within one fiscal year�it's�yes, it's whether it matters whether it's\nin the same fiscal year or not, because it seems to me that the revenues being\ncollected in one fiscal year, the statutory authority might not come until\nanother fiscal year.","index":"00051","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I'm just wondering whether that creates any challenges around\nthe collection of this fee, whether that may need to be revisited at some\npoint, or would this be addressed with the legislation being written, just to\nclarify that if it does go back to a certain date. I'm just seeking greater\nclarity. ","index":"00052","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Again, I think the First Minister put on the record that the\nsocial responsibility fee doesn't currently have statutory authority. That law\nmay come into play sometime in the future. But I'm just wondering because the\nrevenue is being collected right now; it was collected in the Public Accounts\nfor the last fiscal year without having a law in place to justify it. Just\nwondering if the Premier can clarify, just to build on his earlier answer about\nthe rationale he gave. Does it matter if that comes in a separate fiscal year?

The actual social responsibility levy is not�<i>[interjection]</i>�fee�I'm\nsupposed to use the word fee, the clerk tells me�is due on June 30th, 2020.\nThat's been known for some time, and that remains the date of remittance. So\nthe sale, obviously, began much earlier than that. The sale of the product,\ndistribution of the product. But the latitude was deemed to be appropriate\ngiven the fact that we're just in a start-up stage and wanted to make sure that\nthe retailers had the opportunity to get going to establish themselves. And so\nthis is akin to a deferral, I suppose, of the obligation for a period of time.","index":"00054","speaker":"Brian Pallister"},{"html":"����� I would also emphasize that this is not solely a legislative\nissue but actually that this is in the retail agreements that are entered into\nwith each distributor. So it's in the contract with each distributor that\nthat's the structure that we use.","index":"00055","speaker":""},{"html":"����� It is true that this came into force last October 17th. We're\napproaching the�you know, the first anniversary of this significant change.\nIt's also true that we have�as a government had repeatedly urged the federal\ngovernment to get their act together before they introduced it and legalized it\nin specific terms around the issue of production because the production\nlicensing of cannabis, the levels that the federal government had achieved were\nvery low relative to the projected demand. We felt that if they rushed to\nlegalization, there would be a shortage of supply. And there has been a\nshortage of supply. So that has meant that the retailers who were contracted\nwith not only Manitoba but across the country haven't been able to get the\nsupply of cannabis products that they desire to operate their retail\ndistribution or their stores.","index":"00056","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And that has, I'm sure, been of considerable advantage to the\nunderground distribution system for cannabis because they now have a complete\nand full understanding of the distribution models various provinces will be\nusing�are using and are in a better position to compete with the legitimate\ndistribution model. The federal government has said that they are addressing\nthis issue and some small progress has been made, but the fact remains that in\nvirtually every province in Canada, retailers are saying they haven't got\nenough supply of the product to run their stores. And so it's created a�created\ndifferent problems in different parts of the country, for sure. But what the\nretailers are telling us is that they would like to see a more assured supply,\nmore licensed suppliers.","index":"00057","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>* (</b>10:30)","index":"00058","speaker":""},{"html":"Obviously there's also a benefit to them in the sense\nthey can shop more effectively with�you know, in partnership with�now is it\nLiquor &amp; Lotteries that does the buying, or is it the other agency?

With the edibles on the graph, there's a danger (a) that a person used\nto getting high off a certain amount, a certain level of consumption isn't as\nhigh right away, and so they double-consume, double-dose, triple-dose.
