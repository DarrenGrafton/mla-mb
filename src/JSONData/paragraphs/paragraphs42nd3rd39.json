And so, Bill&nbsp;63 also has to be seen within its\ntotality and its connection to Bill&nbsp;57, the protection of critical\ninfrastructure, and Bill&nbsp;62, which is basically an ag gag legislation,\nwhich I think is also important to note that ag gag legislation that we see in\nAlberta and Ontario and that comes from the states; ag gag legislation was actually\ncreated and constructed by the industry in the states, and has been in the US\nand has been used to supress whistleblowers, animal rights activists, et\ncetera, et cetera.","index":"00737","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nso, when we look right now what the Pallister government's priorities have\nbeen, it is predominantly aimed at silencing Manitobans who are�do not agree\nwith the Premier, or do not agree with the actions of his Cabinet, and to\nsquash dissent.","index":"00738","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nso, Madam Speaker, it's really important that we understand that there is a\nsuite of legislation before the House right now that, at some point�unless they\nall get a bit of courage and say, you know what, we're actually going to stand\nup for Manitobans' right to protest; we're going to stand up for Manitobans'\nright to dissent, unless they get a little bit of courage and go against their\nboss�Manitobans need to know that all of these bills will at some point receive\nroyal assent.

I can tell you that Indigenous peoples do\nnot think it's funny. ","index":"00742","speaker":""},{"html":"It is not funny that we have a government that is strategically and\nlegislatively attacking Indigenous peoples on our own territories. On our own\nterritories, we're being told in Bill 63, do not go onto any private property.\nEven if it's not clearly mapped out, don't dare go on private property, because\nyou're risking getting shot.

That's what they're all sitting there allowing\nto happen as we sit here today, in the midst of a global pandemic. It is\nshameful.","index":"00744","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nlet me just say again, Madam Speaker, I don't know if they don't see what's\ngoing on, but Manitobans loathe them; they loathe the Premier; they loathe\nthem.

","index":"00750","speaker":""},{"html":"And also the word landowners. We talk about landowners; I want to\nmention the word and the name Colten Boushie, Colten Boushie, Colten Boushie.\nJust for the simple matter of�and I raise his name in this Chamber, in this\nbasically non-Indigenous Chamber, because Colten Boushie was supposedly guilty\nof trespassing. And I put that in quotes, Madam Speaker, the word trespass,\nbecause Bill 63, the petty trespasses amendment and occupiers' liability act, is\nmeant to define that and meant to categorize people as trespassers no matter\nwho they are, no matter where they are.","index":"00751","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nColten Boushie did not trespass. He was on land that inherently belonged to\nIndigenous people; that inherently belonged to his community; traditional\nterritory of his ancestors and will be traditional territory of his future\ngenerations. So he was guilty of nothing, but yet, he was murdered. He wasn't\nkilled. It wasn't an accident. He was murdered.","index":"00752","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nthen reading this piece of legislation, it just clearly brings back the\nrelevance and the very clear similarities�and maybe I'll use that\nword�clarifies the similarities between that instance and what's going on here\ntoday with Bill 63. And I do want to kind of say an expert�an excerpt that was\nwritten. The minister had talked about other jurisdictions getting it right.\nAnd so, does that mean Saskatchewan got it right?","index":"00753","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nlaw of self-defence or defence of property, both laws require that the\naccused's perceptions of threats and response be reasonable and not simply\nhonestly held.

Moreover, he argued that the Stanleys faced a nightmare\nsituation and that the vehicle there was being used as a weapon and there was\nstealing and crashing and that the jury should decide whether Stanley had a\nlawful excuse for careless use of a firearm.","index":"00756","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So to me, Madam Speaker, that clarifies to me exactly the intent of\nwhat Bill 63 brings forward; it brings forward and incites confrontation. The\nminister talks about this clarifies and this is going to eliminate those\nconfrontations. Fact of the matter is, it's going to incite that even more so. ","index":"00757","speaker":""},{"html":"����� When we sit there, we talk about exactly who is inherent in this\nland and who are the landowners, and the minister talks about if there's a\nfence up there, if there's a fence that clearly defines your land. ","index":"00758","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So all those generations ago, if Indigenous peoples put a fence on\nthe east coast, the west coast, the north and south coasts, is that good\nenough? Would that be good enough to now claim this land as theirs? Because it\nis; it is inherently Indigenous people that are the rightful inherent\nlandowners here, and Bill&nbsp; 63 works to eliminate that, works to try and\nso-called clarify the landowners and the landholders of this territory.","index":"00759","speaker":""},{"html":"����� There's various First Nations within Manitoba that clearly have and\nclearly define�by a way of a sign, mind you, even by a way of fence in some\ncases�clearly define their traditional territory. Their trad�itional territory\nis not bound by the Indian Affairs federal government reserve boundary. It's\nbound by the traditional territory that they share with their ancestors and\nthey share with the neighbouring communities and their neighbouring Indigenous\npeople. ","index":"00760","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So to me that's exactly where this clarification needs to be\nextremely clear, and this minister's piece of legislation does nothing but try\nand cloud that judgment. It's meant to slowly chip away and incite\nconfrontation and incite racism and incite the fact of the matter of anybody's\nwho's trespassing on those areas, because the minister clearly knows and he's\nclearly targeting Indigenous people that are coming to those so-called private\nlands and private areas with Bill 63. ","index":"00761","speaker":""},{"html":"����� When we have those kind of things that is slowly�like I\nmentioned�slowly chipping away and there are a lot of pieces of legislation\nthat are brought forth by this government, Bill 63 being one, that slowly chip\naway at what those are. And at some point in time, they're going to pull back\nthe curtain and say, lookit, we have all these things there to get out there\nand integrate, assimilate and eliminate all Indigenous peoples and their way of\nlife.","index":"00762","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Bill�there was The Wildlife Amendment Act that was raised in the\nfall, I believe, by the member from Gimli, that talked about just simply\nnuisance beavers.

That meant that these farmers\nand these so-called landowners are now going to be walking around armed,\nthey're going to be walking around with a gun strapped to their back, claiming\nto be out there to�by way of that piece of legislation�to deal with nuisance\nbeavers. ","index":"00764","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But now, what happens if that same landowner�and I'm going to use\nair quotes on that: land owner�comes out and says, well, hey, that person is\nnot supposed to be here, those people are not supposed to be on my land, didn't\nyou see my sign? Didn't you�this trail isn't for you.

","index":"00766","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And when we talk about this piece of legislation as�this act being\nbrought forward, it slowly, slowly chips away.

Even though the minister is trying to clarify, saying,\nno, no, no, it's going to take away from that, this is going to now put it in\nthe arms of somebody else to deal with, this is going to alleviate any kind of\nconfrontation, when the fact of the matter is this is going to incite it even\nmore.
