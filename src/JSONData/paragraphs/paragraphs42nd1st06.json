I'll point to\nMilner Ridge correctional facility; we were able to close one of the units\nthere because we had a lower volume of clients in that facility, so that was a\nballpark about 20 positions there. Similarly, Agassiz Youth corrections\nfacility in Portage, we had some realignment there with, again, reduced head\ncount, allowed us to make some changes there.

","index":"00385","speaker":""},{"html":"And I think in Crown Law too, as a result of some reorganizations, we\nreduced the complement there by five.

And so, again, I know you noted a couple\nthere but, you know, what were the positions that were cut? And, I guess, why\nwere they cut? And I think, even more importantly, and I�and obviously this\nwon't come as any surprise to you in by way of a question, is, you know, what\nwill the effect be in the department in respect of executing that service that\nthose particular jobs did via Justice?","index":"00387","speaker":"Nahanni Fontaine"},{"html":"<b>Mr.\nCullen:</b> Thank you for the clarification in terms of those numbers.

So we did make a\nconscience effort, the department did, to turn those part-time people into more\npermanent, full time. So that might be reflective of the numbers you see with\nthe�as being reported by the civil servants�Civil Service Commission. ","index":"00389","speaker":""},{"html":"So that's sort of my take off the top. You know, I did outline, sort of,\nthis past year to this year, what we're looking at in changes.

So we have\nseen over the last couple of years a reduction in the number of clients we're\nserving. So we've been able to actually reduce our complement in the correction\nside.

I\nthink it's a classy example of me�of the Idea Fund where we're taking money,\nwe're looking at programs, we're looking at return on investment, making sure\nthat this is a worthwhile investment.

We had a request for proposal out some\ntime ago, a few months ago. Deloitte<b> </b>was the�had the positive outcome\nfrom that request. They started their work about a month ago in terms of the\nconsultation within the court system. So that's obviously been pretty\nintensive.

I am really curious about the\nIdea Fund; I'll come back to that. But in respect of your last response, is\nthere a particular dollar amount that Deloitte was offered to do this\nconsultation? And do we have any idea, and I know that it's quite preliminary,\nbut do we have any idea of what that new product, whatever that might look\nlike, what that's going to end up costing to overhaul that component of the\nsystem?","index":"00411","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b> (15:40)","index":"00412","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Mr.\nCullen:</b> So, in respect of the contract that we've secured with Deloitte.\nAgain, it was a tendered�it went to the marketplace to see who was interested\nin providing this particular service to us.

","index":"00416","speaker":""},{"html":"And, in terms of what the product's going to cost going forward, that\nwill be largely determined by what we ask them to provide. So we haven't got to\nthat point yet. So we really, we don't want to put any numbers in the window\neither because this will be a tender process. We do know there are other\njurisdictions using similar products in North America. So we know there�the\ntechnology exists.

","index":"00417","speaker":""},{"html":"But, from my perspective, the exercise is about determining what we need\nin Manitoba. And, once we determine what we need in Manitoba, then we'll go to\nthe marketplace and find out what that solution is for Manitoba.
