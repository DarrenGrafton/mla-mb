And obviously, we're into that situation as\nof yesterday. ","index":"00798","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nother part of the question I want to address is in terms of the relationships\nthat government has had with schoolboards and superintendents.

We have a\ncategory for $16&nbsp;million for health and safety. Another category of\n$6&nbsp;million for personal protective equipment. And then another\n$10&nbsp;million for other expenditures.

So, those sort of items would be�would fall under\nthat $16&nbsp;million, health and safety.
