The intention\nof those rules was to develop a date by which bills could be introduced, and\nthey would be guaranteed, not passage, but that they would come to a vote, a\ndemo-cratic vote, in the Assembly. That was the intention of those rules. And\nin exchange, the opposition could select a handful of bills to hold over for\nseveral months if they didn't agree with the bill and they wanted to make that\npoint to the public.
