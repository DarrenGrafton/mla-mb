And just\nthinking about how there is quite a bit of concern around the consultation or\nlack of consultation that may have happened in the creation in coming up with\nthis legislation.","index":"00657","speaker":"Cindy Lamoureux"},{"html":"����� During the question and answer portion of the reading here today,\nthe minister shared how 6 per cent of people who the surveys were sent out to\nsubmitted and gave the surveys back to the government, and 6&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent\nis a lower number, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I think that we'd like to hear back\nfrom, I'd say, at least 50 per cent, if not more. ","index":"00658","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I'm also a little bit concerned about the timeline of these\nsurveys. How long did people have to think about the surveys? How long did\npeople have them sitting in their mailboxes before they could actually send\nthem back? Did the government provide postage for people to have the\nopportunity to send them back? ","index":"00659","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I think there's lots of questions and that a survey didn't have to\nnecessarily only be done through mail. I think that we could have done some\npolling through phone calls, through social medias, through town halls. I think\nthat this legislation warrants a lot more consultation than it seems that it\ndid receive.","index":"00660","speaker":""},{"html":"����� One of our concerns is about how the bill changes the frequency\njust in how often the board would need to submit strategic plans, making it\nevery five years instead of annually, and I believe it's crucial to any\norganization that for strategic planning to be done properly and adequately,\nthere needs to be some accountability and transparency. ","index":"00661","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, taking away this accountability, rather than having annual\nstrategic plans, turning it to five years, it does seem like a step backwards\nand it just doesn't make much sense. It raises some red flags, Mr. Deputy\nSpeaker. ","index":"00662","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The bill also amends a governance of the apprenticeship board by\nrepealing the provincial advisory committees and standing committees. This is\nessentially done by enabling the board to establish committees and to establish\napprenticeship programs for voluntary trades and certification programs.\nThere's just not a lot of consistency in this legislation. ","index":"00663","speaker":""},{"html":"����� This bill isn't consistent of the governance structure, because in\ncertain places of the act, the minister has decided to take power away from the\nboards, giving him, the minister himself, more decision-making power. And as highly\nconcerning as this is, it does seem to be a pattern of this government and, you\nknow, the member from St. Vital spent a lot of time talking about this, so I\nwon't spend too much time on it, but the most recent example I think about is\nBill 33, because we're hearing from students. ","index":"00664","speaker":""},{"html":"����� There is a lot of concern that this government is sort of yanking\npower away from people who would have a lot more experience, a lot more intel,\na lot more reason to contribute quality and efficient information, and the government\nis making it so they can have control over this power. We think about how\nthey're�the government is making it more difficult for international students\nand being able to receive health care and, couple of years ago, taking away\nstudents' tuition rebates. ","index":"00665","speaker":""},{"html":"����� You know, we need to be providing incentive for people to remain in\nthe province, not to leave the province, and some of these decisions in this\nlegislation are concerning. They raise red flags and make us question, is this\nreally going to help tradespeople stay in the province or is it going to\nconvince them to want to leave the province. And our trades is something we're\nvery proud of. We think about how people throughout Canada value Manitoba\ntradespeople. We have tradespeople who go into other provinces all the time\nbecause of the quality work that they do. ","index":"00666","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I'll get\ninto that shortly, but let me give you an example here. This legislation\nenables the board to establish standards of technical training and practical\nexperience for certification programs, creating it so the minister, rather than\nthe board, has the ability to designate trades and occupations and establish\napprenticeship programs for compulsory certification trades. ","index":"00667","speaker":""},{"html":"<i>Madam Speaker in the Chair</i> ","index":"00668","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Again, why in\nthe world would the minister be more qualified in making these decisions than\nthe members and individuals on the board? So, in understanding this and the\nother changes in the bill, we do have some concerns and questions about why the\nlegislation changes the composition of the board, why the bill reduces the\nnumber of persons on the board who represent employers and employees in\ndesignated trades or designated occupations by two. ","index":"00669","speaker":""},{"html":"����� You know, the interests of the\npublic on the board will also be represented less by removing a member and, Mr.\nDeputy Speaker, you can see how we would like to be able to better understand\nthese changes and just the appropriateness of them and how they would actually\nserve apprenticeship programs here in Manitoba. ","index":"00670","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Lots of concerns�it's concerning\nthat the minister should have the control to disallow, and that is the word\nused in the legislation. The minister would be able to disallow the bylaw in\nwhole or in part by written notice to the board. Upon disallowance, the bylaw\nor the disallowed part of it, ceases to be in effect and is deemed to be\nrepealed. It's an important part of the bill, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It's the\nconcern that our tradespeople would no longer be trained one-on-one, but,\nrather, one teacher per two students. ","index":"00671","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And, you know, I'm trying to think\nabout this, and I'm trying to paint an image here. When I think about our\ntrades industry and students learning from their teachers within trades, we\nthink about construction sites; we think about buildings with multiple floors\non them. How is a teacher or an instructor supposed to instruct and teach two\nstudents on working on electrical when one student is on the 13th floor and\nanother student is on the second floor? It does cause�just again, it's raising\na lot of red flags, Mr. Deputy Speaker. ","index":"00672","speaker":""},{"html":"����� It is concerning, and right now,\nas I was mentioning earlier, we are really, really proud of our trade industry\nhere in Manitoba. We've got quality people who are often called to leave the\nprovince just to help out in other areas of Canada because we're that good. So\nwhy are we taking away the teachers and the instructors and having it so one\ninstructor would teach two students, maybe even more if it's the direction of\nthis government. I think that when something is working well, we should be\ntrying to continue to allow that to prosper, and if we know one-on-one teaching\nin apprenticeship programs are working well, why are we going to try and\njeopardize that? ","index":"00673","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We want to maintain it, and there\nis nervousness behind the quality and the fairness of training and learning. We\nwant to keep our reputation and, again, just�we don't quite understand why the\ngovernment is trying to change something that's already working very well and\njeopardizing the future of education and experience for tradespeople here in\nthe province of Manitoba when it's been something that's brought us so much\npride over the years.","index":"00674","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, you know, we're hopeful that\nas this bill heads into committee, we will hear from those who this legislation\nwill be affecting because it appears to remove voices from those who would be\naffected by it. We want to hear from the stakeholders; we want to hear from\napprenticeship programs; we want to hear from students who are learning in the\ntrades from journeymen who are teaching in the trades. This bill gives a lot\nmore power to the government and potentially jeopardizes the quality of\neducation and training that people would receive. ","index":"00675","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So we're looking forward to\ntalking about it further at committee. We're encouraging Manitobans to come out\nand educate us more on this, share your opinion on this. We need to learn more\nabout it because right off hand we see a lot of problems with the bill.

So perhaps we can agree to disagree. ","index":"00700","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But\nwhen it comes to this conversation that we're having in our household, a parent\nto a child, a group decision, a family discussion, I can't help but reflect on\nthe conversation that I had recently with a mother by the name of Cindy\nSkanderberg. She is somebody who has fought long and hard in Manitoba for us to\nhave the current apprenticeship rules and laws that we have today. ","index":"00701","speaker":""},{"html":"����� She\nwas put on this fight not because of anything that any of us would ever want to\nexperience as parents. She embarked on this journey after the tragic early\ndeath of her son, Michael, who was killed on the job at only 19&nbsp;years of\nage. And I'm not, you know, the youngest person in the Chamber anymore, nor&nbsp;&nbsp;am&nbsp;&nbsp;I\nthe oldest person, but I do reflect on somebody at 19&nbsp;years of age and\njust think of how many more years that that person should have been able to\nenjoy life, how many more opportunities that person should have been able to\nenjoy and how much potential has our whole society lost on because that young\nlife was cut short. ","index":"00702","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nso, I was very moved to talk to Cindy just a few weeks ago when the government\nannounced this terrible new regime that they're bringing in with respect to\napprenticeships in Manitoba. And she told me point-blank that she feels if the\ngovernment gets its way with Bill 61, accompanied by the regulation changes that\nthey enacted effective December 18th, then the death of her son will have been\nin vain. That is absolutely shameful, Madam Speaker. ","index":"00703","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nbackground to her saying this is such: this mother, grieving as she was from\nthe death of her son who was killed on the job, embarked on a career of\npolitical advocacy that began in, I believe, the late '90s and stretched into\nthe 2000s. And it brought her to this historic building; it brought her into\nmeetings with many elected officials�of all partisan stripe, I'm sure. ","index":"00704","speaker":""},{"html":"And, eventually, it saw changes made to ensure that young people like\nher son, Michael, would actually be guaranteed, through a safe apprenticeship\nprogram, to be able to come home safely at the end of the day after they go to\ntheir training program or their work site in the morning. ","index":"00705","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nthat's why we in the NDP always take health and safety so seriously. That's why\nhealth and safety is something that we always stand up for for the working\nperson, whether it's the Hydro worker, like those that we were joined with\noutside today, whether it's the apprentice on the job or whether it's the\ncustodian in the school. No matter where somebody works, whether they're the\nnurse in the health-care facility or the health-care aide in a personal-care\nhome, no matter where somebody works, that person deserves to come home safely\nat the end of their shift.

","index":"00707","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nreason why the regulation change is relevant is because this government, in\nwatering down the one-to-one apprenticeship ratio to two-to-one, is going to\nmean less supervision, less health and safety for those young people in\nManitoba who are trying to gain a skilled trade, or for those Manitobans who\nhave been put out of work by this government, who are looking to retrain and\nupskill and pick up a trade so that they can find a new vocation and join in\nour economy.

The government also\nchanged the regulations so that a supervisor need not even potentially be in\nthe same location as one of these apprentices.

And the best way for us to ensure that\naccess to those good jobs are enjoyed by people from all walks of life, all\ngender identities, all cultural communities, all geographic communities in\nManitoba, is to ensure that there are good training programs, good\npost-secondary programs and, most importantly, apprenticeships that guarantee\nthe health and safety of their participants.
