That's an agreement that was supposed to have been signed more than a\ncouple of years ago, and yet there are many programs that have never been\nenacted, that have yet to be up and running, including a maternal-care program.\nThe same is true for the guns�the so called guns-and-crime fund, which was\nmassively undersubscribed even though we were in a meth crisis.

The fact is that what they did is in the first year of the PC\ngovernment, spending went up, and then it was frozen for two years straight.\nThis has also happened with infrastructure, which actually declined, cuts to\nmunicipalities and so on.

And so we had questions, a series of\nnine questions which were raised by the MLA for Portage la Prairie, who is\nstill a part of the government.

November 23rd of\n2015, the member for Portage la Prairie (Mr. Wishart) asked the fact�about the\nfact that the government was taking away the Children's Special Allowances. He\nsaid: \"Can the minister tell this House whether children in care benefit\ndirectly from the Children's Special Allowances, or does it just disappear into\ngeneral revenue?\" Well, the NDP minister at the time didn't ask�didn't\nanswer the question very well, and we now know that that money went into general\nrevenue. So the MLA for Portage la Prairie then asked: \"Why did the NDP\ngovernment end the practice of directly benefiting the child in care?\"\nwhich the NDP had done. And the minister of the day, the NDP minister, goes on\nbut doesn't provide an explanation of why the NDP ended this practice of\ndirectly funding and benefiting children in care.","index":"01393","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Then,\nin his third question, the MLA for Portage la Prairie says this: Before 2012,\nCFS agencies often ran deficits due to ever-increasing numbers of children in care.\nThis NDP government decided to take the money held in trust for CFS children\nwhen they turned 18 and use this money to pay off the deficit in that agency.\nThere were no agreements in place to allow them to do this; the government took\nmoney which was held in trust for children when they aged out of care at age\n18. The MLA for Portage goes on to say: Mr. Speaker, this NDP government stole\nthis money from the trust fund of the children in care, and in doing, stole\ntheir good start in life. And what we now know, from the reports of many\npeople, is that a lot of these children, when they aged out of care, end up in\nhomeless shelters because they had no other resources and because those\nresources had been taken away from them by the provincial government of the\nday.

And he says: historically the\ngovernment enjoyed sovereign immunity from tort liability. Liability and tort\ndepends on whether the government has agreed to be held liable in tort for the\nact of omission in question. Such consent is expressed in the relative federal\nand provincial Crown liability legislation. The Crown has only consented to be\nliable if the act or omission would be tortuous if done by a private party. It\nis not consented to unique Crown liability. The Supreme Court has either\nignored or effectively eviscerated this legislation when ministers try to\nprovide liability for the acts that they do.
