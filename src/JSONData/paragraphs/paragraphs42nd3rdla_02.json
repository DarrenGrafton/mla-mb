You know, there are�we have a lot of concerns around suspending\nand expelling students in these particular stories, because some of the\ncircumstances that are&nbsp;&nbsp;coming to our attention are where there isn't\nnecessarily imminent�a threat to other individuals and it's more about a\nbehavioural issue.

And I wonder if\nyou're seeing concerns brought to your office with addictions and how�you know,\nwhere are we in terms of being able to provide the adequate support. ","index":"00367","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Ms. Krone:</b> So to the first point\nthat you were making around contact with children with the disruptions in the\neducation system, it's an issue that the advocate has been concerned about\nsince the suspension of in-class learning earlier the�last spring. ","index":"00368","speaker":""},{"html":"It's something that\nshe raised with the Department of Education, and we continue to, you know, to\nwatch that carefully because we were also concerned, along, you know, along\nmany�along with many community organizations and educators and schools\nthemselves�concerned about some of those young people for whom coming to a\nschool, coming to a classroom, being connected to their teacher is a really\ncritical aspect of their safety net, and sometimes it can also be that the\nplace where they feel the safest in their day is coming to school, and where\ntheir teacher is a beacon of safety and hope for them. ","index":"00369","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so when there are\ninterruptions to those systems, that can be incredibly difficult, impactful and\nrisky for some of those kids. And so we�you know, we are definitely concerned\nabout the abilities of those young people to stay connected with some of those\nsafety nets. It is something that, you know, I'm glad to hear that, you know,\nyou're also concerned about that. It's something that, you know, we'd be happy\nto chat about later in addition to, you know, kind of the time constraint piece\nright now. ","index":"00370","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But that is absolutely something\nthat the advocate remains concerned about is, you know, because we know that in\nthe province, not everybody has the ability to connect remotely through their\nclassroom or, you know, through the digital means that are available to many of\nus, you know, in other circumstances.","index":"00371","speaker":""},{"html":"����� With respect to your comments\nabout addictions, I would say that that is also something that the pandemic is\namplifying and exasperating in the lives of a lot of young people here. ","index":"00372","speaker":""},{"html":"So, whether that is\ncalls coming in, cases that are coming to our attention with respect to ongoing\naddiction issues where young people are seeking treatment and seeking supports,\nyou know, all of that stuff is being impacted by the abilities of young people\nand their families to access services in ways that meet the needs of young\npeople. ","index":"00373","speaker":""},{"html":"����� One of the things that the\nadvocate has spoken about and written extensively about is this piece around\nensuring that services, you know, with respect to mental health and addiction\nin particular, that those services need to be available when kids are ready for\nthem. ","index":"00374","speaker":""},{"html":"And what we continue\nto see in Manitoba and, again, is written about extensively in the Advocate's\nreports, are issues around wait lists and wait times sometimes becoming the\nsignificant barrier to young people actually receiving the treatment that they\nrequire and to which they're entitled. ","index":"00375","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, you know, there's�there are\nexamples where young people identify themselves; they come to our office and\nthey say, okay, I'm ready. And there just isn't a service that's available for\nthem. And that, again, is incredibly hard, you know, as advocates for young\npeople, and it's also hard for the service providers who just say, we actually\njust don't have a bed right now. ","index":"00376","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So it's one of the reasons why the\nadvocate has made specific recommendations to that effect that those services\nneed to be expanded and it's an area that we continue to monitor in terms of compliance\non those recommendations through our act and an area that we'll continue to\nwatch moving forward. ","index":"00377","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Mr. Gerrard:</b> One very quick\nquestion: Do we know if children who are in care are more likely than other\nchildren to have problems with addictions and, if so, what measures need to be\ntaken to help prevent addictions?

","index":"00380","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so\nwhether that's more prevalent in CFS, I wouldn't be able to speak to.
