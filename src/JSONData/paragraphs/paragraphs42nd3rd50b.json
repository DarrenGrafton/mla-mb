In fact, it has been recognized nationally for the reduction in\nred tape that we have undertaken in a number of different ways.

","index":"00567","speaker":""},{"html":"����� This\nparticular iteration of The Reducing Red Tape and Improving of Services bill\nhas a number of different provisions. One is the phasing out of the enhanced ID\ncards. I think when the enhanced ID cards were brought in by I believe it was\nthe former NDP government, there was a good reason for it, Mr.&nbsp; Deputy\nSpeaker, in terms those who were crossing international borders, of course,\nmost clearly, the one an hour south from here, the international border at\nPembina or at the other crossings that we have along the border, to have that\nas an option that could be accepted. ","index":"00568","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now,\nsince that time, there have been many changes when it comes to security and\nrequirements and passing international borders, and it's become much more\ncommon now for residents to have pass�ports because you're required to have a\npassport to fly internationally. And so we simply don't see the need for this\nas much as we did with passports or Nexus cards in some situations, Mr. Deputy\nSpeaker. But there will be a phase-out period to provide the ability for those\nwho are relying on these enhanced ID cards to find and to be provided another\nform of ID that is suitable for them. ","index":"00569","speaker":""},{"html":"����� There\nare also changes, as recommended by the Chief Electoral Officer, Mr. Deputy\nSpeaker, that allows for electronic signatures to be used in filing\ndocumentation with Elections Manitoba. All of us who have run for elected\noffice, and that is, of course, is everyone who was elected here, will know\nthat there are a number of requirements that are asked for annually, but\nparticularly at election time, from Elections Manitoba, and they have to be\nfiled generally by hand, and that can be cumbersome. And for those who live\nquite far away from Winnipeg, it can be difficult to ensure that that is being\ndone.

But what this government continually does is fail to stand up\nfor Manitobans, fails to stand up for working Manitobans. In fact, they go much\nworse than failing to stand up for them; they blatantly outright attack them at\nevery opportunity that they get.

","index":"00575","speaker":""},{"html":"����� You\nknow, they talk about all these wonderful things they've done, but here's young\nManitobans that want to get apprenticeships to get out of poverty. What's one\nof the best ways of getting out of poverty? Well, we all know it's to get a\ngood-paying job. The best-paying jobs for a lot of young people are trades\njobs. But this bill interferes with what's been a long-standing practice and a\nlong-standing piece of legis�lation that requires, on public projects�so,\nprojects where the governments are putting public money into�the previous act\nthat this act wants to completely do away with�not change, not make better, not\ntweak, not reduce red tape�it just wants to plain, flat out do away with�the\nrequirement that those public works projects have apprentices as part of it so\nthat con�tractors that are taking on these projects know upfront that they have\nto employ apprentices to start helping young people get ahead. ","index":"00576","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But\nthat's not what this government is about. They're not about Manitobans getting\nahead.

","index":"00577","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nreally and truly, perhaps what should've been done with the apprentice part of\nthis bill is to say, you know what, we need to make sure that more of these\npublic works projects employ more apprentices so that more young people in\nManitoba can get raised out of poverty. That would've been a worthwhile venture\nfor this government. Wouldn't have cost them a dime either.

They care&nbsp;\nabout the dollars, not the sense, because there is no sense in withdrawing the\nrequirement to have apprentices employed in public works projects. Doesn't make\nany sense whatsoever. Employing more apprentices, getting more people trained\nwould've made some sense. ","index":"00579","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But\nwe've seen in other pieces of legislation as well, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that\nreally, that's not what this bunch is about again. They've done away with\nproject labour agreements that really made sure that, again, young people got\ntraining, that they knew upfront what was going to be required of these\nprojects. But instead, this government is all about racing to the bottom to\nmake sure that the only ones that come out ahead are their rich corporate\nfriends that don't support Manitoba and don't pay taxes in Manitoba. This bill\nwill allow contractors to come from all over and not employ Manitobans. ","index":"00580","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nchanges to the apprenticeship ratio will make it worse for young Manitobans to\nget apprenticeships, to get full certification, to get red seal trades, but it\nwill make it cheaper for this bunch's corporate friends to make money; to take\nmoney out of your pocket, to take money out of your son's and daughter's\npockets.
