First is the prohibition on interacting with farmed\nanimals, and second is the prohibition on giving farmed animals food and water.\nAnd we're concerned about this bill because, as you've already heard tonight,\nit is an example of an ag gag law. These originated in the United States and,\nin the past year and a half we've begun to see them cropping up in Canada as\nwell. These laws are aimed in whole or in part at preventing individuals from\nobserving, docu�menting and publicly exposing the conditions in which farmed\nanimals are raised, transported or slaughtered. ","index":"00243","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, as\nmentioned, the first overarching concern that I would like to discuss is that\nBill 62 would create a new and incredibly broad offence of interacting with\nfarmed animals. I'll focus my comments on section&nbsp;13.2(2), which applies\nto animals in transport, but 13.1(3), which applies to animals in a biosecurity\nzone is also troubling. ","index":"00244","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Section\n13.2(2) is virtually identical to section&nbsp;6(2) of Ontario's recently\nenacted ag gag law and, in fact, it appears much broader, in fact, than Ontario's\nlaw. So, like Ontario, it appears to be targeted at individuals who engage in\npeaceful protest activities on public property near slaughterhouses. It will\ncapture a vast array of harmless activities and, without definition, it's hard\nto really even conceive what it means to interact with an animal in transport.\nDoes it include speaking to animals? Making eye contact? What if you take their\nphotograph? What if they nudge you or otherwise come into contact with you when\nyou're near the truck? ","index":"00245","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Professor\nJodi Lazare has already presented this evening on the potential\nunconstitutionality of Bill 62. I agree with her analysis and her conclusions,\nbut rather than echoing her presentation, I will instead focus on the broader\nlegal context in which Bill 62 is being introduced.","index":"00246","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Canada\nhas some of the worst animal transport standards in the industrialized world.\nCows and sheep can be legally transported up to 36 hours without food, water or\nrest. Horses and pigs can be legally transported up to 28 hours without food,\nwater or rest. Animals are transported year-round during our extremely cold\nManitoba winters and on balmy summer days. Canadian Food Inspection Agency, or&nbsp;\nCFIA, data shows that in federally inspected slaughterhouses alone, more than 1\nmillion animals arrive dead each year, having died during transport. Nearly 9\nmillion more are classified as condemned, meaning that due to conditions\ndiscovered before or after they are slaughtered, they cannot be consumed by\nhumans. ","index":"00247","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nreasons for an animal being classified this way would include bruising,\nfrostbite, emaciation and&nbsp; other conditions. So, again, this data includes\nonly federally regulated slaughterhouses. It does not include provincial\nslaughterhouses. So the numbers of animals dying in transport are actually much\nlarger.","index":"00248","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Individuals\nprotesting on public property near transport trucks raise awareness about these\ncruel conditions and, at times, these individuals are able to observe and\ndocument conditions inside trucks. As a lawyer, I am often contacted by\nindividuals who have gathered footage showing conduct that appears to violate\nfederal transport standards. I'm then able to use this footage and information\nto submit law enforce�ment complaints to the CFIA and provincial enforce�ment\nagencies.","index":"00249","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nfootage that I'm forwarded, frankly, is often heartbreaking. It has included\npigs dead in sweltering vehicles <i>[inaudible]</i> some are foaming at the\nmouth and in clear distress; animals bleeding from open wounds, some of them\ncaught in crates in clear distress as they struggle to free themselves; and\nfeather-bare chickens with bright red skin exposed to freezing temperatures. ","index":"00250","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Because\nthe vast majority of animals raised and slaughtered for food spend their lives\nindoors on private property, it's only during transport that mem�bers of the\npublic can generally see the animals and observe their treatment. ","index":"00251","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now, I\nwant to be clear that prohibiting indi�viduals from interacting with farmed\nanimals and restricting peaceful protest activities outside of slaughterhouses\ndoes nothing to protect biosecurity. Animal Justice has reviewed CFIA records\nrelated to&nbsp; biosecurity incidents and disease outbreaks at Canadian farms\ngoing back nearly 20 years. This data shows not a single disease outbreak or\nbiosecurity breach linked to the activities of animal protection advocates or\nprotesters.","index":"00252","speaker":""},{"html":"����� All of\nthe incidents were caused by farm owners and operators themselves and they were\ncaused by things like shared needles or equipment; workers entering multiple\nfacilities; feeding animals other animals, as in the case of mad cow disease;\nor viruses that move back and forth between animals and workers, as we've seen\nvery recently with COVID‑19 outbreaks at mink farms in BC. And, in\nManitoba, some of these incidents have included an anthrax outbreak that led to\n146 farms in Manitoba and Saskatchewan being quarantined, an H5N2 avian flu\noutbreak at a turkey breeding operation north of Winnipeg and several outbreaks\nof porcine epidemic diarrhea virus.","index":"00253","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, I've\nprovided you a brief to complement my presentation tonight and that brief sets\nthis out in a little more detail, so I'll leave that to committee mem�bers to\nreview but what I really want to say is that taking photographs or videos of\nanimals in a transport truck does not pose a biosecurity risk. Peaceful\nprotestors do not pose a risk to animals or food safety. ","index":"00254","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nsecond main concern that I have is that sections 13.1(3) and 13.2(2) would make\nit an offence to give a farmed animal food or water. This is completely\nunnecessary. This is not a pressing issue. There are no groups of animal rights\nactivists running around Manitoba looking for farmed animals to give food and\nwater to. You know, we're in the midst of a pandemic and I struggle to\nunderstand why prohibiting giving food and water to animals is a priority at\nthis or, frankly, any other time.","index":"00255","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Second,\nin the extremely rare instance where an individual does give a farmed animal\nfood or water, they are not harming the animal, particularly when an animal is\nexhibiting signs of thirst, malnourishment or heat exhaustion. Giving the\nanimal food or water would, in fact, alleviate their suffering and it should\nnot be an offence.","index":"00256","speaker":""},{"html":"����� You've\nalready heard that on rare occasions when individuals give an animal�such as a\nthirsty pig in a hot transport truck�when they give those animals water, those\nanimals have nonetheless entered the food system and been slaughtered. So no\nharm has actually been caused to the food system either. ","index":"00257","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now, I\nexpect some supporters of the bill may say it's necessary to make it an offence\nbecause, you know, who knows what a person is really giving an animal, but this\nis not a convincing argument. It is already illegal to give a farmed animal a\npoisonous or injurious substance. If an individual were to do so, they would be\nviolating The Animal Care Act and also the Criminal Code of Canada. ","index":"00258","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Finally,\nthe offence is plainly illogical and I would say excessively punitive. If Bill\n62 is passed as is, it will result in severe penalties and even imprison�ment\nfor acts of compassion. It would mean that an individual in Manitoba who has a\npig, either a pet or one they're raising for meat, if such an individual fails\nto provide the animal with adequate food and water, they leave the animal\nexposed to the elements or even if they violently abuse that animal, they could\ngo to jail for a maximum of six months, in addition to some $10,000 in fines. ","index":"00259","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(19:10)","index":"00260","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In\ncontrast, a concerned citizen, who gave that very same animal food or water,\ncould go to jail for up to a year, in addition to, again, $10,000 in fines. And\nI say to you that this is plainly unjust and illogical. ","index":"00261","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, in\nconclusion, without significant amend�ment, Bill 62 would violate animal\nprotection advo�cates' rights to expression and peaceful protest, as you've\nalready heard. It'll make it harder to docu�ment and expose the suffering of\nanimals in transport, keeping consumers in the dark about where their food\ncomes from and silencing animal protection advocates under the guise of\nbiosecurity.

I\nagree with you, but I would say that it would need to go much further than\nthat, because the notion of interacting is so broad that�you know, we focus a\nlot on videotaping and photographing, and that's for good reason. But it would\ncapture a much broader range of activity and potentially just create a chilling\neffect for any protests that happen, even on public property, even without\ndisrupting vehicles. But if they occur near those vehicles it's really hard to\nsay what activities could and could not be construed as interaction. Certainly\nindividuals at vigils, they do speak to animals often and they do so and they're\nthere to show those animals compassion. Speaking to somebody is clearly\ninteracting and there is obviously, clearly, no biosecurity risk from that\neither.

Holding vigils,\nbearing witness and offering farmed animals perhaps the only moment of\ncompassion they've had their whole lives before they're slaughtered is a\nparticular strategy of peaceful activism, and this bill essentially\ncriminalizes this strategy.","index":"00294","speaker":""},{"html":"����� As\nsuch, it seems to me a pretty clear violation of our Charter-protected rights\nto freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, and as I'm sure this committee\nis aware�and as we've heard a little bit tonight�Canadian legal experts have\nalso sounded the alarm over this bill and warned that it may very well be\nunconstitutional.","index":"00295","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Bill&nbsp;62\nis not an isolated legislative incident; it's part of a larger phenomenon, as\nwe've heard tonight, known as ag gag laws.

","index":"00472","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, we\nare both disappointed and strongly oppose Bill 62, which amends The Animal\nDiseases Act, or any legislation that would impede the ability of people who\nare working to expose cruelty to animals, would prevent anyone from exercising\ntheir right to freedom of speech or prevent anyone from providing assistance to\nanimals in distress. ","index":"00473","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I\nunderstand it has been said this bill is being put in place because of\nbiosecurity concerns and to protect the animals. Rest assured, animal activists\nare not here to harm an animal, and the very things that activists are exposing\nand objecting to on factory farms and during transportation are often the very\nthings that scientists are saying are contributing to the spread of disease.\nSo, if we want to prevent spread of disease and protect animals, as has been\nsuggested, perhaps we need to start actually listening to the activists. ","index":"00474","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Science\nhas shown that factory farming in itself has increased the risk of the spread\nof disease and pandemics due to overcrowding, highly stressful conditions,\nuntreated industries and the filth that some animals live in or exposed to\nduring transportation on their way to slaughter or during live export. This is\na breeding ground for disease. So, what we need are better animal protection\nlaws and not legislation that endorses the very cause of pandemics and punishes\npeople for speaking up against it. ","index":"00475","speaker":""},{"html":"����� According\nto the CFIA, almost 2 million animals arrive dead or are dying by the time they\nreach the slaughterhouse each year. Some have been trans�ported for many, many\nhours without food or water, in their own filth and extreme heat and cold. So,\na young person taking a photograph exposing the horrific conditions of these\nanimals for journalists or the benefit of the general public is not the\nproblem. The taxpayer has the right to know the truth. So, I have never heard,\nand legal experts shared tonight, that an activist getting close to a transport\ntruck, taking pictures or giving water to an animal in distress on a sweltering\nhot day is or has ever been the cause of the spread of disease. ","index":"00476","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The elephant in the room and\nwhat is well documented, and scientists have repeatedly said, if we truly want\nto reduce the chance of pandemics, then we need to transform our food systems\nto more plant-based diets, as is currently reflected in the Canada Food Guide,\nwhich I understand was developed by 37&nbsp; scientists without the influence\nof industry groups who were profiting from the sale of meat and dairy. As a\nresult, the food guide is now over 90 per cent plant-based, which is clearly\nbetter for our environ�ment, our health and obviously, the animals. ","index":"00477","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, I'm\nasking you, too, to make decisions based&nbsp; on science and represent the\ninterests of all Manitobans. Currently, Manitoba, however, seems to be going in\nthe wrong direction by continuing to promote factory farming, expanding things\nsuch as pig slaughter businesses, which will, no doubt, contribute to further\ndisease, have a detrimental effect on our environment and potentially cause the\nnext pandemic. ","index":"00478","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, if\nthis bill was truly a conversation about biosecurity, and we truly want to\nreduce our risk of the spread of disease, a good start would be by im�proving\nthe living conditions of the animals that you eat and helping our farmers\ntransition to plant-based farming or more sustainable and humane systems where\nanimals don't suffer and human health isn't at risk.","index":"00479","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In the\ninterest of all Manitobans, we need to move away from factory farming now, but\nit appears the motivation of this bill has nothing to do with pre�venting a\npandemic or the protection of animals. So let's talk about the real issue. ","index":"00480","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Animal\nactivists have played an important role in exposing horrendous animal cruelty\nto the public, and more people are starting to pay attention. We appreciate\nwhat they do because we all know when you speak up for animal welfare, you\nbecome a target, and that's exactly what this bill is about. The industry wants\nthem shut up.

It is far from humane. ","index":"00484","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nprocess to obtain semen from a bull is to stick an electric prod up the anus\nand electrocute him until he ejaculates.

It's called a rape rack. Castration without pain\nmeds and blunt-force euthanasia or thumping is common practice in breeding\nfacilities, particularly in hog farms. Baby pigs are killed by smacking their\nhead while the mom often watches from her gestation crate. And, finally, it's\ncommon practice in the egg industry for live male chicks to be placed on a\nconveyor belt which leads to what is comparable to a meat grinder because they\nwere born male; they can't lay eggs. I think by now, we all saw what took place\nrecently at Brady landfill.<b> </b>","index":"00486","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>����� </b>I\nmust admit the industry is nothing that we should be proud of. It's an industry\nthat requires more transparency and less cover-up. So what's clear to me: what's\ngoing on in these factories is not farming. It's an insult to true farmers, and\nsomething is seriously wrong with anyone that thinks that any of this is\nremotely acceptable in this day and age. ","index":"00487","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, as\nthe public becomes more aware of the inhumanity in this industry and the damage\nit's doing to our environment, our health and we recognize that animals were\nnot put on this earth to be treated in this way, more people are speaking up.\nIf the industries involved did not have something to hide, they would not have\nasked this legislation to be put in place. ","index":"00488","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But\nagain, our Province seems to be going backwards by endorsing plans to continue\nto expand our pig-slaughtering business, exporting more live animals, exposing\nthem and increasing the risk of spreading disease to us all, while continuing\nto tell us this is to feed the planet when the World Health Organization has\nlisted pig flesh�commonly referred to as bacon�as a No. 1 carcinogen and red\nmeat, No.&nbsp;2, and we could actually end world hunger by going plant-based.","index":"00489","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So in\naddition to the moral issues I raised, this pro�posed legislation has been\nwidely criticized as being unconstitutional. Legal professionals from across\nCanada have given you that advice, so I will just say, if you choose to go\nahead and pass the legislation, then I ask that the lobby groups who asked for\nit also be the ones required to pay for the expense involved in the likelihood\nof a Charter challenge, because that's not what I want my tax dollars spent on.\n","index":"00490","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In\nclosing, I ask you, what message are we sending to today's youth when mental\nhealth issues appear to be at an all-time high and laws are being proposed that\nmake it a crime to show compassion? Are these the people we want to fill up our\njails? It simply isn't fair or reasonable to impose a penalty of $10,000 and\none year�a one-year jail sentence for giving water to a thirsty animal, but a\nfirst-time offender who violently abuses an animal in Manitoba can only be\nsentenced up to six months in jail under The Animal Care Act.","index":"00491","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nplease put this bill aside, sit down with Animal Justice, representatives from\nthe Winnipeg Humane Society and the various animal save movements and instead\nbring forward legislation that Manitobans can be proud of that will result in\nmore humane treatment of animals and reduce the risk of another pandemic. If\nthere wasn't a need, the activists would not be out there. No animal in\ntransport should be dying of thirst, so spend the time dealing with the\nproblems the activists have identified, as some of these are also contributing\nfactors to the spread of disease, which will most likely result in our next\npandemic.","index":"00492","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And,\nfinally, I leave you with this: as we are in the midst of a global pandemic, we're\nwatching our seniors die, our businesses close, our friends lose their jobs and\nmental health issues go sky-high, and we hear this bill is set to pass on April\n29th, my husband and I are concerned that the only thing worse than Manitoba\ntoday is Manitoba tomorrow, and we're counting on you not to let that happen.

My name is Elizabeth McCandless, and I'm appearing\nas a private citizen, but I will mention that I'm a lawyer and I work for the\nManitoba Law Reform Commission. I also co-chair the Animal Law Section of the\nManitoba Bar Association. I'd like to thank you for allowing me the opportunity\nto speak tonight about Bill 62. ","index":"00570","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Bill\n62 has been introduced with the stated objective of enhancing safety to farm\nanimals, their livestock and the public's food supply, by prohibiting\nindividuals from entering biosecurity zones, inter�fering or interacting with\nanimals in biosecurity zones or with animals in transport. ","index":"00571","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now,\nenhancing biosecurity is an important legislative purpose, especially with the\nrealities of COVID‑19 on everyone's minds. However, a closer look at the\nbill suggests that the proposed amendments don't actually address biosecurity\nrisks. So I will briefly discuss the purported biosecurity aspect of the bill,\nand then I will address what happens�what appears to be the actual intent of\nthe bill and why that matters.","index":"00572","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nwhen analyzing proposed legislation, the first step is usually understanding\nthe overall purpose. For a penal legislation�which is legislation that imposes\npenalties and creates offences, as is the case here�the question is often what\nis the mischief the Legislature is trying to address? In reading the text of\nBill 62 and weighing it against available facts, it appears that it is not\nintended to address biosecurity as one of the main objectives. ","index":"00573","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\njust to go back to the stated objectives that we've heard in Legislative\nAssembly and in govern�ment statements on the bill upon its introduction�first\naddressing the concern over safety to farm families. As other presenters have\nalready discussed, Manitoba already has legislation at both the provincial and\nthe federal levels to provide protection from trespassers and individuals\ncoming onto farms and harming farm animals or damaging property. Likewise,\nthese pro�visions would provide protection to livestock living on those farms.\nSo there are already in place other legislative mechanisms to deal with the\nsafety of farm families. ","index":"00574","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Second,\nand more commonly cited as the legis�lative purpose, we hear about the safety\nof Manitoba's food supply and enhanced biosecurity. So, if the government is\nadvancing this proposed legislation to protect livestock and our food supply\nfrom biosecurity risks, then one would expect the decision to be based on the\nevidence. But the reality is that there's no evidence to support the assertion\nthat members of the public coming into contact with livestock is actually\ncausing animal diseases to spread. ","index":"00575","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And we've\nalready heard from a couple of speakers already. Kaitlyn Mitchell of Animal\nJustice mentioned that publicly available CFIA investigation reports reveal\nthat the most common causes of outbreaks of disease are things like workers\nworking in multiple facilities, needle sharing, feeding dead animals to other\nanimals, interactions between live�stock and wild animals, and worker-to-animal\ninfections. And, importantly�and this must be em�phasized�there are no recorded\nincidents of an animal advocate coming in contact with a farm animal and\ncausing the spread of disease. ","index":"00576","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nanother thing that I wanted to point out with respect to the issue of\nbiosecurity risks is that in January 2021, the Auditor General released a\nreport examining whether the Department of Agriculture and Resource Development\nis prepared for an animal disease emergency. And I note that the government\naccepted all the Auditor General's recommendations contained in the report. In\nthe report, biosecurity is defined as measures taken to prevent exposure to\nharmful biological or biochemical substances. And the report concluded the\ndepartment is not adequately prepared for an animal disease emergency. It noted\nsome areas where the government had some things in place, but noted that there\nwere some additional deficiencies that needed to be addressed. ","index":"00577","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Importantly,\nnowhere in the report did it point to increased risk of animal disease from\ninteraction with or interference from animal advocates, nor did it�did the\nreport mention the adoption of the kind of legis�lation contemplated here. In\nshort, calling something biosecurity does not make it biosecurity. ","index":"00578","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\ncoming back to the question of legislative intent, the evidence does not\nsupport the assertion advanced by the government that these amendments are\ncreated to protect farms or enhance biosecurity. So, that leads us to question,\nif Bill 62 is not intended to address biosecurity risks on farms or in transport,\nthen what is it actually trying to address? ","index":"00579","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(20:40)","index":"00580","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Looking\nat the wording of the bill and the broader context, it is quite clear that the\nbill is intended to prevent animal activists who bear witness to and document\nthe lives of farmed animals in factory farms or on their way to slaughter. This\nis clear in the wording of the subsections set out under section 13.1 and 13.2\nof the bill and the fact that there are no other proposed amendments that\naddress any of these situations that have resulted in outbreaks, as I stated\nearlier. ","index":"00581","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I don't\nthink Manitobans would find it acceptable for their government to enact\nlegislative changes based on anecdotes from the industry as opposed to the\nevidence, especially when it comes to something as important as animal\nagriculture. ","index":"00582","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nfurther, Bill 62 potentially infringes on freedom of expression and the right\nto peaceful protest as provided for under sections�subsection 2(b) and 2(c) of\nthe Charter. ","index":"00583","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now, I\nwon't address the Charter issue further, but I suggest members seriously\nconsider the letter that was signed by legal experts signalling the potential\nCharter issues in this bill, and I also support the submission made by Dr. Jodi\nLazare and Kaitlyn Mitchell of Animal Justice and others who've ex�pressed concerns\nabout potential Charter issues.","index":"00584","speaker":""},{"html":"����� One\nconcern about Bill 62 that hasn't been touched on as much yet is the definition\nof biosecurity zone. The definition has largely been left for the regu�lations,\nso we don't know yet what will be included in this definition, but I point this\nout because, in addition to the concerns about Charter issues with animals in&nbsp;\ntransport, as far as Charter rights go, it would be&nbsp; particularly\nproblematic if the definition of bio�security zone were to encompass public\nproperty, for example. ","index":"00585","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Just\nto conclude, in keeping with the principles of openness and transparency in\ngovernment and in keeping with the fundamental freedoms set out in the Charter,\nrespectfully I do not support the adoption of Bill 62. In light of our current reality\nin dealing with a global pandemic that was likely caused by animal-to-human\ntransmission, Manitobans want more oversight and transparency about animal\nagriculture in our province, not less. The more the industry conceals what\nhappens to farmed animals, the more the public believes it has something to\nhide.","index":"00586","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nthose are my submissions, and I thank you for the opportunity to speak this\nevening.

So, it is disappointing to see that level of\ndisengagement.

So\nthat's one way.","index":"00599","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nother way that this might not help is that if we are amending The Animal\nDiseases Act at this stage to implement some changes that won't actually result\nin increased biosecurity enhancements, then will the government be as open to\nrevisiting the act so soon after to implement those changes that were outlined\nin the Auditor General's report that would actually result in some positives?

I&nbsp; actually asked the minister in question period to\nmore clearly tell us what he meant and what he was meaning in terms of\nbiosecurity zone, and I didn't get a very good answer. So, I think that it\ncontinues to be an important question and that we should be getting better\nanswers to that. ","index":"00602","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nthank you.

Hoping you can just, as a lawyer, give us a bit of your sense\nof what's going to happen or what kind of legal risks might a young activist\nface if they end up participating in some kind of, you know, documentation of\nsome kind that would put them on the wrong side of this law.

","index":"00607","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Ms.\nMcCandless:</b> Thank you for that. ","index":"00608","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Let me\njust grab�so, I believe some of the other speakers already addressed some of\nthe penalties in the act, and kind of, some of the concerns that�of the\npenalties that they could be facing if they were to be found in these kinds of\nsituations. ","index":"00609","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nyou know, there's a risk of fines. And when we look at fines to private\nindividuals and�perhaps, belonging to organizations without a lot of\nfunding�that kind of funding can�that kind of fine can have a very detrimental\nimpact. And as we mentioned already, somebody who is found�convicted of these\noffences could face up to a year in prison, which is particularly problematic\nwhen you consider, you know, the types of activities that could be seen as\ncompassionate: providing water, or just being, you know, as discussed earlier,\ntaking photos or whatever, whatever that might entail. ","index":"00610","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nyes, there are some fines that are a problem, and that's something that I hope\nthat the committee considers further.

","index":"01117","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nI'll just make note of a couple incidences. In August 2020, Brandon's Maple\nLeaf Foods facility reported cases of COVID‑19.

","index":"01219","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nwe've begun to see that where there have been�you know, at first this was\nsomething that we would see in the US, but we've increasingly seen that in\nCanada, where we do have people who will storm onto the farms and try to create\nhavoc there for the farms. ","index":"01220","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nthese cows are looked after. We�you know, for example, our barns today are\nbuilt with maximum cow comfort in mind. For example, in my barn we have, you\nknow, we have special rubberized flooring for comfort. We've got foot baths,\nwe've got a big grooming brush�self-activated grooming brushes that cows can\nattend to whenever they want and a milking system where they can be milked on\ntheir own sche�dule. And so, those�the focus is on cow comfort. ","index":"01221","speaker":""},{"html":"����� One of\nthe things you would have to know about cows is that they are also very�they're\nsensitive animals. They recognize the caregivers that are with them every day\nand they can be agitated if you would suddenly have, you know, strangers come\nstorming into the barn, because that is something that they don't know, they\ndon't recognize. ","index":"01222","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\ncertainly from a disease perspective, I should get back to our�the biosecurity\nelement of our assur�ance program, and that is to prevent disease from com�ing\nonto the farm and, if you have something on the farm, to try to keep it on the\nfarm and not let it get off. And, of course, you know, trying to prevent the\nspread of it on the farm is critical.

And there\nis�through our biosecurity, each one of us works with our veterinarians to\nestablish a program that we're going to follow on the farm, in terms of a\nvaccination program and in terms of how we can, you know, how we can manage any\nkind of a disease on the farm; and also, obviously how to prevent�and\nthat's�the key is to try to prevent this from ever com�ing�different disease\nfrom ever coming onto the farm. So that is done in consultation with a vet. ","index":"01224","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so\nwhen we�when people want to come onto the farms, you know, that is done with\npermission ahead of time. Arrangements are being made, and of course, then all\nthe necessary precautions can be taken so that people don't inadvertently bring\nsome kind of, you know, disease or, you know, those kinds of things onto the\nfarm and infect the cows. ","index":"01225","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So we\nare very careful of those kind of things. It's very important to our program\nand, again, we see this more in Canada where there is a�you know, people\nbursting onto the farm and creating havoc that way. We are�and, of course, it's\nnot only the concern for people that, you know, that come on. It doesn't matter\nwho they are, whether they're protestors or whether they're somebody that's\ncoming on for any other reason. To simply have them come on and come into the\nfacility or come into where, you know, we're hous�ing cattle outside, is a\nrisk. ","index":"01226","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And,\nof course, you know, this comes back to the point of actually taking care of\nthese animals and looking after, you know, for the best welfare outcome for our\nanimals. ","index":"01227","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so\nwe strongly support this legislation, which is actually�the timing of it fits\nvery well with our program.

As a result, animals at\nintensive livestock operations throughout the province are subject to standard\nindustry practices that cause significant pain and distress, including crowding\negg-laying hens into battery cages so small that they cannot spread their\nwings, confining mother pigs in gestation and farrowing crates so small that\nthey cannot turn around, grinding male chicks alive in macerators, and\nperforming painful mutilations without anesthesia, including slicing off the\ntails of piglets, debeaking hens, and castrating cows and pigs.

A \"biosecurity zone\" is defined as an area at a farm or\nslaughterhouse that meets certain criteria. As currently defined, it appears to\ncapture areas of farms and slaughterhouses that are already off-limits to the\npublic.

The images captured by these groups have often been used to submit\nlegal complaints to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and to provincial\nanimal welfare law enforcement authorities when it appears federal and\nprovincial laws governing the transport of animals have been violated.
