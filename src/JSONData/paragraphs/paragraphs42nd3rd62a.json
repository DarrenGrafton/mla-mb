It was literally impossible for them to\ncover these additional costs, and that meant that they were either going to be\nforced to move out and find cheaper accommodations�which is chal�lenging in\nthis current market�or they were going to be forced to make some very hard\nchoices about reducing their food intake or the medicines they needed to buy.","index":"00015","speaker":""},{"html":"����� When\nwe dug into the validity of these huge increases, I was shocked to learn that\nevery single one had either been approved by the Residential Tenancies Board or\nwas in the process of being approved by the RTB.

","index":"00031","speaker":""},{"html":"����� A\nsecond key issue which we heard about from renters and others is that our\ncurrent RTB legislation allows property owners to charge an AGI prior to it\nbeing approved by the RTB director. In my own community, this has resulted in\nfamilies receiving a notice of an above-guideline increase and actually having\nto pay the increased costs before the increase is even approved by the RTB. In\nthese situations, tenants are promised that additional funds will be returned\nto them if the increase isn't approved but it is&nbsp; totally ludicrous that\nrenters should be forced to&nbsp; shoulder any costs prior to an\nabove-guideline increase actually being approved by the RTB.","index":"00032","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Consider\nthis for a moment: we are currently forcing renters, many of whom are seniors\nor low-income families, to carry these costs on behalf of a property owner,\nsometimes for months at a time. This shouldn't be happening in any way, shape\nor form, and other Canadian provinces have prevented this by clearly stating\nthat a rent increase cannot be charged to a renter until it is actually\napproved by the RTB. Our amendments would help to solve this problem.","index":"00033","speaker":""},{"html":"����� A\nthird concern which we identified was the use of rent discounts by property\nowners as a means of luring tenants into renewing their leases after an\nabove-guideline increase. In these situations, the renter is told that an AGI\nis being applied to their rent when they renew their lease but that they'll\nreceive a discount of some degree, which will offset the costs of the AGI. ","index":"00034","speaker":""},{"html":"This creates a false sense of security for tenants, who sign their new\nlease with a much higher rent thinking that the rent discount also needs to\nremain in place for the duration of the lease but, in reality, our current RTB\nlegislation allows property owners to remove the rent discount with only three\nmonths notice, meaning renters can be put in precarious situations without\nlittle warning.","index":"00035","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Our\namendment proposes to fix this issue to protect renters by preventing landlords\nfrom removing a rent discount in the same year an AGI has been granted. ","index":"00036","speaker":""},{"html":"����� A\nfinal key issue identified is that in those cases where a large AGI is needed,\nour current RTB legis�lation does not permit the director of RTB to direct that\nthe increase be spread out over a longer period of time to mitigate the impacts\nof that rent increase on tenants.","index":"00037","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In BC,\nfor example, they've granted this power to the RTB and this has helped to\nreduce the sticker shock associated with some of the more extreme increases. In\nlooking at some of the increases granted in Manitoba in 2019, some were\n50&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent and higher. No tenant should be expected to pay this level\nof increase in one year and our proposed amendments would allow the RTB to\nreduce the financial impact of a particularly large increase by spreading it\nover a period of years, as determined by the director. ","index":"00038","speaker":""},{"html":"����� This\ngives the property owner an opportunity to recover costs associated with an\nextraordinary invest�ment, but it also ensures that renters aren't shouldering\nthe burden of these additional costs in a short time�frame.
