","index":"00061","speaker":"Scott Fielding"},{"html":"����� We\nhave deferred about $3 billion of taxes. This one measure, including the\ncommercial component of it, will save an average business about $880: again,\n$880 a year.

If Bill Gates walks\ninto a bar, on average everyone becomes a billionaire. It doesn't mean that\nthat's the actual saving that each business will have. So, I mean, part of the\nconcern here is that this will actually overly�or benefit large property\nowners, whether they're residential or commercial. ","index":"00063","speaker":"Dougald Lamont"},{"html":"����� Has\nthere been any thought about the distribu�tional impacts of this? I mean, the\nfact is that it means that some large operators will save much more than small\nand medium-sized businesses. Is this something that the minister has taken into\nconsideration? ","index":"00064","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Mr.\nFielding:</b> The way we calculated, there's about&nbsp;&nbsp;60,000 businesses\nhere in the province. About 42,000 commercial properties will benefit from this\nmeasure saving each business, as they mentioned, about $880. You're absolutely\nright. It depends on how big�of how much savings they're going to have. I would\nalso argue, though, bigger and smaller businesses, depending on how big a size\nyou are doing this, has a bigger and smaller impact. ","index":"00065","speaker":"Scott Fielding"},{"html":"����� So\nthis is something that gives cash back�money that wouldn't be spent, and what\nis important about this is businesses may be deferring a whole bunch of costs\nas they're probably doing, but probably deferring insurance is something that\nthey're not going to do because you don't want to be in an issue where you\ndon't have insurance. So this will be true cost savings for businesses. ","index":"00066","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Mr.\nWiebe:</b> The minister referred to savings for corporations, for businesses.\nI'm wondering if he can just detail what the impact to the Treasury would be in\nterms of the loss of revenue for the Province for making this change. ","index":"00067","speaker":"Matt Wiebe"},{"html":"<b>Mr.\nFielding:</b> Well, I would put it the other way. I would say it's $75 million\nof tax savings for businesses and residents�or, individuals that are here. I\nthink anyone that probably owns a house or other types of insurance�or\nbusinesses and commercial will benefit from this. ","index":"00068","speaker":"Scott Fielding"},{"html":"����� So\nthis is $75 million of cash on hand that businesses and residents won't have to\npay; $75&nbsp;&nbsp;million�it's around 35, $36 million for the commercial side\nand around the same amount�somewhat right around that amount for the\nresidential side. ","index":"00069","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Mr.\nWiebe:</b> And, as the minister mentioned, those corporations which are larger\nwould benefit the most. Likewise, those who, I guess, pay the most in their\nhome insurance would also benefit.

","index":"00070","speaker":"Matt Wiebe"},{"html":"����� Again,\nif the minister can detail what the hit to the Treasury would be in terms of a\nloss of revenue, making these changes which benefit mostly the large\ncorporations and, of course, those who have to insure some of the most\nexpensive houses and homes in our city. ","index":"00071","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Mr. Fielding:</b> Well, on this side of the House, we don't consider\nit government money. We consider it the people's money and taxpayers' money,\nand that's why we're giving $75 million of tax support relief to residents.\nThere's about 510,000 residents who will benefit from this as well as close to\n42,000 businesses. It's their money which they pay in. This is tax relief. ","index":"00072","speaker":"Scott Fielding"},{"html":"����� We\nknow businesses are struggling. We've deferred over $3 billion of tax relief\nfor Manitoba businesses.

They have been either laid off\nor fired in many cases where there is no employment, and what that translates\nto in respect of child maintenance is that there are parents who are required\nto give monthly maintenance in support of their children, but it may be that\nthat particular parent has lost their job and so nowhere in this legislation do\nI actually see any measures on how child maintenance is actually going to deal\nwith whether or not a parent is able to pay their monthly maintenance fees to\ntheir child.","index":"00408","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We know and we have seen many, many instances of parents\nco-parenting and trying to find the right way to co-parent during a global\npandemic when we are meant to practise social distancing, and so there are many\nparents that are dealing with that.","index":"00409","speaker":""},{"html":"����� There are many parents, Manitoba parents, that are dealing with the\nstress of co-parenting and also trying to mitigate and navigate their\nchildren's stress as well and so to that end, we don't see anything in Bill&nbsp;&nbsp;56\nthat would help mitigate any of the financial stresses that families and, in\nparticular, parents who have child maintenance orders are facing.","index":"00410","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Madam Speaker, we know that when parent�a parent does not pay their\nmonthly child maintenance fee, it has direct consequences on the child that\nthat money is meant to support. <span lang=\"EN-US\">We don't see any consideration\nof those scenarios that we know Manitoba families are facing, in fact, today as\nwe sit here. </span>","index":"00411","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� Madam Speaker, I think that it's important to put\non the record, as well, there's some concerns in respect of what is deemed\nreasonable.
