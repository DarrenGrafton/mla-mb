The employer has an ability and is required to make sure that the\nemployee feels safe. At that point, if there's a disagreement still between the\nemployee and employer, then workplace health and safety gets involved in that\nand makes the determination of whether the proper protocols are in place and\nhow they would address the issue.","index":"00053","speaker":"Scott Fielding"},{"html":"<b>Mr. Sala:</b>\nCould the minister clarify that this bill would also allow for leave to take\ncare of an extended family member such as an aunt or uncle even if they aren't\nregular dependants?","index":"00054","speaker":"Adrien Sala"},{"html":"<b>Mr.\nFielding:</b> That is something�I'll give an example for someone who maybe has\nchild-care needs: if you've got a child or you're caring for a loved one.

It was unreasonable to allow health-care workers to be\nexposed not only to health-care risks, but also to financial risks for them and\ntheir families.

I believe that is all of us on\nthis side of the House, what we want today, and we are hoping that that\nsentiment exists throughout this House.","index":"00081","speaker":"Cameron Friesen"},{"html":"����� Let me simply say the following about Bill 59. Bill 59 seeks to\nmodernize�or perhaps I'll use a different word. It seeks to make certain small\nimprovements to The Public Health Act. This act was first debated in this\nLegislature in 2006. It wasn't actually receiving royal assent until 2009, but\nyou may say that this is the first official test drive of the bill. This is the\nfirst real chance to see this bill as it works in the context of a major\ncircumstance like COVID-19 and, indeed, we have that opportunity now.","index":"00082","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, Madam Speaker, as the Chief Provincial Public Health Officer,\nwho I can name, Dr. Brent Roussin,� who has has been doing an incredible job in\nhis role, as well as Lanette Siragusa from Shared Health, and I will take this\nopportunity at this point in time to say how well served all Manitobans are not\nonly by their leadership, but also by those leaders that Manitobans do not see,\nthat incident command structure table, those key leaders. So to them and\nthrough them to their various teams, we say thank you for your excellent\nleadership engagement, long hours, hours away from home, deliberations,\ndecision making that is occurring each and every day on behalf of Manitobans.","index":"00083","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(16:20)","index":"00084","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now, the chief has advised me that as he has continued to act to\nkeep Manitobans safe, to put orders into effect, orders like the need to limit\nthe size of gatherings, first at 50 and then lowered and then lowered again,\nbut also to advise people to stay home, to close businesses that are deemed to\nbe non-essential, to create some conditions around those businesses to be\nclosed, and other measures as well that there has been some limit of his\ncapacity to do so, a limit that is not exhibited in the same way in other\njurisdictions. In other words, there was something that needed to be\nadditionally granted to allow Brent Roussin, the chief, to do his job fully. ","index":"00085","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And that is why this bill would seek to strengthen the authority of\nthe Chief Provincial Public Health Officer, in order to give�to order special\nmeasures to prevent, reduce or eliminate a serious and immediate threat to\npublic health presented by a communicable disease epidemic or, as in the case\nof COVID-19, a pandemic, and to strengthen the authority to enforce orders of\nthe chief. ","index":"00086","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, in brief, as I said, it was first debated in 2006 and passed in\n2009, but I can tell you that more recently when it has come to certain things\nthat the chief has sought to do, like to mandate the isolation of persons\nreturning to Manitoba, it was actually discovered that the chief didn't have\nthe authority under The Public Health Act at the current time to do so. We were\nable to find some workarounds, but less effective, less efficient. Some of this\nproceeded from the activity of the federal government to enact provisions of\nthe Quarantine Act that were seeking to make people self-isolate when returning\nto Canada while in the same way, provinces like Newfoundland and Nova Scotia\nand BC sought and received that ability to, under the public health act, keep\npeople at home who had travelled back home from other provinces or from areas\nwithin the province. ","index":"00087","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We discovered that we did not have this provision in Manitoba, so\nthis would seek to remedy that in specific. However, there are other provisions\nas well that this would seek, including certain orders about the closure of\nbusinesses, establishing social distance requirements that are permitted to\nstay open, the limitations of businesses not only now as�if I can use a\ncolloquialism�as we're ratcheting down certain provisions that Manitobans�but\nthen later when we subsequently begin to release them. ","index":"00088","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The chief will also need certain additional flexibility, as is in\nplace in other provinces, to be able to say how and by what measure we will\nallow businesses to reopen. Maybe the chief will make a decision to say that\nretailers will have to have a mask on. I don't know, but the chief will need to\nhave a mechanism by which he can there order those things. Maybe he will intend\nto create some social distancing parameters within businesses to make people\nremain two metres apart. Well, then we will need some ability in law to be able\nto enact those things, and the chief will need those provisions. ","index":"00089","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So these are unprecedented circumstances. This bill clearly says\nthat these measures are used in extraordinary circumstances. That should be a\nform of comfort to everyone. As I've already said, in other jurisdictions there\nare these powers, but not here. As I already said, as we release these\nmeasures, it will be important to have that ability to do so. ","index":"00090","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I want to speak just briefly then before I end on enforcement of\norders. We have noticed additionally some gaps when it comes to the ability to\nenforce orders that are issued by the Chief Provincial Public Health Officer,\nincluding in relation to the authority of officials to take action to carry out\norders when there isn't compliance. Manitobans will know, I think it was a week\nago, there was a certain establishment in the city of Brandon where they were\ndefying the orders to close even though they were non-essential. This was a\ntattoo�I don't know if you say tattoo parlour or if you just say tattoo\nestablishment�but in this case they weren't closing. We didn't have the ability\nunder The Public Health Act to actually enforce the closure, so we were able to\nuse another mechanism, which was less efficient, in order to accommodate that.\nBut we need to make this right, and this would allow us to do this. ","index":"00091","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So this�these proposed amendments would also&nbsp;&nbsp;enable\nother officials, other individuals like conservation officers or liquor\ninspectors or Workplace Safety and Health officers, retired police officers to\nbe able to come in and enforce these measures, as well. And I heard ripples of\na conversation from the opposition leader in a hallway about an hour ago,\nsuggesting that the opposition <span lang=\"EN-US\">has concerns about these powers\nbeing vested to these officers to be able to enforce measures. I want to say,&nbsp;it's\nimportant to have enforcement measures. Just because the highway traffic limit\nsays 100 kilometres on Highway 3 between Oak Bluff and Carman, it doesn't mean\nthat every police officer is going to give a ticket to everyone. But the speed\nlimit is important and must be enforced, and in the same way we know that these\nenforcement issues are real. </span>","index":"00092","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� Manitobans are also perceiving that they are very\nreal and we need that additional mechanism to get compliance because we have\ndone well in Manitoba.

But I would say in this place today that we need to continue to\nexercise this compliance and cooperation and this will help us.</span>","index":"00093","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� So I invite the debate on this bill this\nafternoon. I invite the engagement of other parties. We believe that these are\nreasonable issues, that they are reasonable even in terms of the set limits for\nthe fines. We are saying in this case that we noticed that there was an\ninequity here, that the fines in this case that were going to be levied when it\ncame to an emergency�or a public health emergency, were actually lower than\nthey would have been for an emergency health hazard order, which could have\nbeen like, your backyard was full of junk and old tires and so you got a fine.\nNow, imagine that that fine could have been higher than one for not complying\nwith an order on public health during a global pandemic.</span>","index":"00094","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� We won't levy all the fines. There are\nactually�there are actual penalties that are right now in place,&nbsp;&nbsp;whereby\npeople could simply have a ticket written to them.

I couldn't respect the physical distancing because my house was on\nfire, and so I had to run out into the street and it just so happened I\ncouldn't physically distance from the firefighters and, you know, the other\npeople on-site.

But I won't go any further on that, Madam Speaker, and simply say\nthat I think that ultimately what we're trying to do is give the opportunity\nfor legislation that's brought forward to have the scrutiny that Manitobans are\ndemanding of us right now.</span>","index":"00247","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� And, you know, all eyes are on the actions that we\nare taking here today, and I believe for good reason.

And as I said, there's not\nnothing that sets people off more than when governments seem to be\noverreaching. They want a government that's reacting and is working together\nwith its citizens getting that&nbsp;input, getting that good advice and then\nacting on it in a way that helps the collective.

We want to not only appreciate the work that they're doing, but then\nalso as legislators come together and say if the government needs additional\npowers, how can we do that in a way that doesn't infringe on those rights that\nManitobans inherently want to have. And that is a fine line in some cases to\nwalk, and it's a fine line that can only be, I believe, achieved, as I said, in\nthis Legislature when we work together but we don't give up any of the\nabilities that we have to look at each piece of legislation in its proper\ncontext.</span>","index":"00249","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� I know that members are, as we speak, pouring over\ndetails within the bill.

Again, this\nis no small task. This is something that I believe every, you know, every\nManitoban who's had the chance to look at the bill or understand its context\nwould appreciate is no small task.

These MBLL members come from\ncommunities across Manitoba, providing excellent customer service to consumers\nand contributing to their local economies.","index":"00953","speaker":""},{"html":"Bill 15 is a\nfurther erosion of the public liquor retailing and distribution model that has\nserved Manitobans so well for many years. This legislation enables restaurants\nto sell beer, wine, cider and coolers to customers who order food for delivery.\nThe change would add risk to the safe sale of alcohol by potentially increasing\nsales to minors and those already intoxicated- something that the public system\nmitigates against. The Bill also allows MBLL to enter into a liquor\ndistribution agreement with a third party rather than use the publicly owned\nand operated distribution centre. While the changes in this bill are relatively\nminor, we caution the government in moving too far down a path that puts\nManitoba's public liquor retail and distribution model at risk.","index":"00954","speaker":""},{"html":"The public\nsystem is known to provide very high levels of customer satisfaction with\nproduct experts with vast knowledge and a wide variety of selection. We know\nthat the public liquor retailing system is also the safest way to sell a\ncontrolled substance, in order to ensure our communities and youth are safe.\nThe most compelling reason to ensure that our liquor stores and sales remain\npublic is that MBLL returns over 280 million dollars annually to provincial\ncoffers to fund vital public services.","index":"00955","speaker":""},{"html":"Importantly,\ncustomer satisfaction surveys rate front-line staff at public liquor marts as\nextremely professional and very knowledgeable about the products they offer.","index":"00956","speaker":""},{"html":"Public Liquor\nMarts are constantly modernizing to serve Manitobans best from Express Liquor\nMarts in grocery stores to home delivery�something that could be improved and\nexpanded given the circumstances we are all facing during the COVID-19\npandemic.","index":"00957","speaker":""},{"html":"One of the\nimportant roles that well trained and knowledgeable staff plays is in ensuring\npublic safety. Public Liquor Mart staff is trained to spot underage buyers and\nrequire proof of age if the customer appears to be under 25, and won't sell to\ncustomers who are already intoxicated. This results in less under-age drinking,\nand safer communities. In the past, MBLL has also invested millions of dollars\nto promote safety, help parents talk to their kids about alcohol and help fund\naddictions treatment services.","index":"00958","speaker":""},{"html":"The recent spike in thefts at liquor stores also highlighted the steps\nthat MBLL took to ensure staff and the public are safe when shopping in liquor\nmarts. While there is still room to improve, it is unlikely that a private\nliquor retailing system would have dedicated the resources and taken the\nmeasures to ensure concrete action was taken to improve the retailing\nexperience.","index":"00959","speaker":""},{"html":"The public liquor retailing system is also good for public services that\nwe all depend on. MBLL has contributes over 280 million dollars to government\nrevenue annually. This revenue helps support health care programs, education,\nmental health and addictions treatment and other services that Manitobans\ndepend on. If this system is privatized, this profit will flow to large\nmultinational corporations rather benefit Manitobans. As a crown corporation,\nwe all own MBLL�and it's accountable to all of us, not to a handful of\nshareholders and foreign investors.","index":"00960","speaker":""},{"html":"As you deliberate and debate Bill 15 and make decisions in the future, we\nurge members of this committee and the government to be cautious in making\nchanges that could impact the public liquor system that provides good quality\nservice, ensures safety comes first, and contributes to our public services and\neconomy.","index":"00961","speaker":""},{"html":"Michelle Gawronsky<br>\nManitoba Government and General Employees' Union","index":"00962","speaker":""}]}
