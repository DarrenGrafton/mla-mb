I am the current chair of the\nexecutive committee of the family law section of the Manitoba Bar Association.\nI've practised family law in Winnipeg at the firm of Duboff Edwards<b> </b>for\nmore than 25 years, and my practice has been almost exclusively in the area of\nfamily law for the past 15 years.","index":"00041","speaker":""},{"html":"����� With respect to Bill 24, The Legal Profession Amendment Act, we,\nthe members of the Manitoba Bar who practise family law, recognize that these\namendments are intended to merely empower the Law Society to undertake the\nestablishment and regulation of limited legal practitioners. They are\npermissive provisions in this legislation, not mandatory, as they should be in\nour view, perhaps with one exception that I will address near the end of my\npresentation.","index":"00042","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We\nalso recognize that while the authority which is sought to be provided to the\nLaw Society is to&nbsp;&nbsp;enable them to regulate and license limited\npractitioners generally, the intent expressed by the Law Society, in line with\nthe recent policy direction of the Manitoba government, focuses on the area of\nfamily law.","index":"00043","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(18:10)","index":"00044","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Let me\nsay and start that as a general premise, the area of family law does not lend\nitself readily to the involvement of paralegals and limited practitioners in\nthat it is an area of the law first and foremost focused on dispute and\nconflict resolution, whether through negotiation, mediation, arbitration or\ntrials before a court, and this is similar to such areas of the law as civil\nlitigation or the criminal law. These areas of the law can be distinguished\nfrom more transactional areas of the law, such as real estate conveyancing,\ncorporate transactions and probate and administration of estates. ","index":"00045","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\ncritical distinction is connected to the role of the exercise of professional\njudgment which, in the area of legal services, can only properly be�and properly\nand effectively provided without undue risk to the recipient of such services\nby an individual with sufficient legal education, training, mentorship and\nexperience.","index":"00046","speaker":""},{"html":"����� No\nparalegal or limited practitioner should be placed into a position that\nrequires the exercise of professional judgment based on legal education and\ntraining. The practice of law for centuries has been viewed as a profession.\nThe essence of a profession is the exercise of professional judgment based on a\ndeep and thorough understanding of the accumulated knowledge relevant to the\nfield in question. This precludes many areas of legal practice from being\nundertaken by limited practitioners, particularly if they were to operate\nindependent from the supervision of lawyers. ","index":"00047","speaker":""},{"html":"In areas of the law, such as real estate trans�actions, wills and\nestates, there are numerous functions which one could see being\ncost-effectively and safely carried out by paralegals or limited practitioners,\nnot involving the exercise of pro�fessional legal judgment, such as the\ncompletion of transfers of land, setting up minute books for corporations,\npreparing documents for probate court and the like. Functions within these\nareas of law requiring the exercise of professional judgment, such as advising\nclients on the share structure or governance of a company or the effective tax\nand estate planning, can properly remain to be provided by lawyers trained and\nexperienced in these areas.","index":"00048","speaker":""},{"html":"Now one might ask, could we not imagine a similar approach in the area\nof family law? Could a&nbsp;&nbsp;limited practitioner, for example, not be the\nprofessional to prepare the necessary court appli�cation, supporting\ndocumentation for a client? And this is precisely where the difficulty starts. ","index":"00049","speaker":""},{"html":"This is because, even in the preparation of initiating court\napplications in the area of family law,&nbsp;&nbsp;this immediately requires\nthe application of professional judgment that a limited practitioner would have\nprohibited�prohibitive difficulty in exer�cising, particularly in the absence\nof the input and supervision of a properly trained and experienced lawyer. ","index":"00050","speaker":""},{"html":"The same challenges arise in alternative-dispute resolution methods\napplied to family law, such as mediation and arbitration. The reason this is\nthe case is simple. It boils down to this: aside from perhaps the determination\nof child support in the limited case where the child in question is\npredominantly with one of his or her parents and the other parent has income\nderived solely from employment where they receive a T4 slip, no area of family\nlaw is consistently and reliably so clear-cut that it does not involve or\nrequire the sophisticated exercise of professional legal judgment. ","index":"00051","speaker":""},{"html":"Family law is an area where it is not uncommon for a lawyer to have to\nbe able to grasp the difference between the child psychology concepts, for\nexample, of justified estrangement versus parental alienation, and at the same\ntime, appreciate the conclusion of a report by a certified business evaluator\nregarding the value of a jointly owned small business or perhaps one owned by\nonly one of the parties, and doing that all in the same case. ","index":"00052","speaker":""},{"html":"This is not to say that we do not believe there is a role for limited\npractitioners in the area of family law. But the cost and therefore the\npotential access to justice advantages of limited practitioners that they\nrepresent must be balanced with the necessity of ensuring the availability of\nthe application of proper professional legal judgment where required in every\ncase and for every client. ","index":"00053","speaker":""},{"html":"In our judgment, the key measure by which this may be assured would be\nto require that limited practitioners must operate under the supervision of a\nlawyer. ","index":"00054","speaker":""},{"html":"In the last few months, there has been a certain amount of interaction\nand consultation between the Law Society and the Manitoba Bar Association on\nthe issue of petitioners. The Law Society has had an online questionnaire to\nwhich I expect many lawyers have responded.","index":"00055","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In\naddition, the executive committee of the Family Law<b> </b>section of the\nManitoba Bar Association, which I represent, submitted an approximately 10‑page\nmemorandum to the Law Society shortly after the conclusion of the online\nquestionnaire. I have emailed copies of both these documents to the committee\nclerk earlier today to be made available to members of the committee.","index":"00056","speaker":""},{"html":"����� There\nhave been some�there has been some planning for meetings between senior Law\nSociety executives and the Family Law section executive, but those have not yet\ntaken place.","index":"00057","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I have\nreviewed many of the questions put by members to the honourable Minister of\nJustice (Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp;Friesen) at second reading of this bill. I was struck\nby how strongly there seemed to be a presumption on the part of the honourable\nminister as&nbsp;&nbsp;well as members that limited practitioners would, in the\nvast majority of cases and perhaps even exclusively, be working under the\nsupervision of lawyers.","index":"00058","speaker":""},{"html":"����� However,\nthis is at odds with a significant portion of the content of consultation which\nhas occurred with the Law Society, both in the online questionnaire the Law\nSociety put out for lawyers to respond to and in their position paper�the Law\nSociety�on which the questionnaire was based. In their position paper, there is\na significant discussion and inquiry premised on the concept that these limited\npractitioners may not all practise under the supervision of lawyers. ","index":"00059","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nthere seems to be a significant disconnect between the Law Society's views and\nthe views expressed by some members of the House, including the honourable\nminister, as to whether these independent practitioners will be required to\nwork under the supervision of a lawyer or not.","index":"00060","speaker":""},{"html":"����� It\nseems to me that the honourable member for River Heights, Dr. Gerrard, may have\nhit the nail on the head when he observed during his remarks at second reading\nthat members were being told that the&nbsp;&nbsp;goal was that limited practitioners\nwould be supervised by lawyers�but that was not specifically provided for in\nthe amending legislation.","index":"00061","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nthere I will close�therefore, I will close my remarks to the committee by\nsaying that I believe the&nbsp;&nbsp;honourable member for River Heights had an\nextremely good point and that this committee, and the House, should consider\nand pass an amendment to this amending legislation specifying that these\nlimited practitioners should be required to practise under the supervision of a\nlawyer.","index":"00062","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I\nthank the committee for its time and await any questions that members may have\nfor me.","index":"00063","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Thank\nyou.","index":"00064","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Mr.\nChairperson:</b> Thank you for your presentation, Mr. Feldschmid.","index":"00065","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Do\nmembers of the committee have questions for the presenter?","index":"00066","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Hon.\nCameron Friesen (Minister of Justice and Attorney General):</b> Thank you, Mr.\nFeldschmid, for appearing here this evening to convey the points that you have\nmade.

Like, is\nthat even possible to be able to execute that? ","index":"00076","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Mr. Feldschmid:</b>\nYes, I think it would be. I mean, to some degree, it would sort of formalize\nsomething that to a large degree already happens informally. But what I mean by\nthat is that in law firms across this province, including my own, there are\nsenior legal assistants, we call them, who are not really able because there\nhasn't been a formal legal establishment of such a position, to call them\nparalegals, but these are individuals who have long years of experience, have\nall kinds of knowledge, and I suspect that a large number of people who might\nconsider going into this role may, in fact, be people who have acted as legal\nassistants for a long period of time.","index":"00077","speaker":""},{"html":"I don't know what the education requirements are going to be there. One\nthing I would suggest is that there be an ability for people who have been\nsupport staff in the legal profession for long periods of time, that they may\nbe having an opportunity to challenge any final exams that any education\nprogram has so that they may be able to be certified without having to attend\nsomething that is really just going to, in large part, educate them on issues\nthat they already are well familiar with.","index":"00078","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But I\ncertainly think that it's�to my mind it's almost the natural fit, it's the\nnatural course, to have people in this role to be working with and under the\nsupervision of lawyers and have a very positive impact on law firms. One of the\nissues with law firms�in comparison, say, to my perception of what I see in the\naccounting field�is that we're very flat. There's lawyers and there's support\nstaff and not much in-between, whereas if you look at a lot of accounting\nfirms, the larger ones, there's a lot of gradation and right fitting, right\nsizing, I would say, the service to the cost of the individual working for the\nfirm providing it. ","index":"00079","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And I\nthink this may be a positive influence for the profession to copy a little bit\nmore from that model that we see in the accounting profession by the\nintroduction of this sort of intermediate professional position compared to\nwhat we have now.

","index":"00092","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I have\na very broad practice, and ultimately what I want to leave the committee with\ntonight is the thought of, are we giving up on access to justice? ","index":"00093","speaker":""},{"html":"This is something I have struggled with since I've been a law student. I\nshould quickly acknowledge that the Green Party of Manitoba doesn't have a\nformal policy on this position, but access to justice is something that's passionate\nto the party, to ourselves, but also to me personally. I really worry that the\nnet effect of this, in many ways, may end up becoming a two-tiered legal\nsystem. ","index":"00094","speaker":""},{"html":"����� A\ncouple of lessons that were quickly instilled with me when I first went to law\nschool�two 'coints'. First point of civil litigation: if the claim isn't worth\n$100,000, it's not worth pursuing. This is one that I was�learned in my first\nyear of university. ","index":"00095","speaker":""},{"html":"But that's really unfortunate, because that leaves a large gap between\n$10 and $90,000�or $99,000�where justice is really inaccessible. And\nultimately, I would suggest to you, a market-only system is going to have a\nmarket failure. ","index":"00096","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We\ndon't expect our education system to operate this way. We don't expect our\nhighway system to&nbsp; operate this way. So we're expecting market mechanisms\nto solve something that they're not designed to solve. It's almost inevitably\ngoing to result in a market failure. ","index":"00097","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I\nstruggle with this because I really appreciate the comments of the last\npresenter�there seems to be, if we look at Ontario, a certain inevitability\nabout this. But in creating two standards in the legal profession, I really\nworry who's going to get left behind and if what we aren't doing, ultimately,\nas a society, is giving up on access to justice. ","index":"00098","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I\ncertainly recognize, as the last presenter said, that ultimately, this is going\nto be left to the Law Society of Manitoba. And don't get me wrong, they do a\ngreat job out there, as does the entire�virtually, the entire profession, in my\nexperience, of lawyers across Manitoba. ","index":"00099","speaker":""},{"html":"But there's a lot of concerns that need to be considered further. Yes,\nthey can set insurance standards, but how is that going to affect insurance\npremiums for all lawyers across Manitoba and payouts to the public through\ntheir claims fund? ","index":"00100","speaker":""},{"html":"����� My\nfriend before mentioned conveyancing. I recognize his point, how some of that\ncan be administrative and certainly can be done under the supervision of a\nlawyer by a paralegal, but at the same time that means income from the Law Foundation\ncould drastically go down depending on how that's regulated, and it isn't clear\nto me what the intent to do with that with respect to this bill is. ","index":"00101","speaker":""},{"html":"And that's important, because the Law Foundation funds important\norganizations like Legal Aid Manitoba; the Public Interest Law Centre. So, you\nknow, as a legal practitioner, I really have some concerns about this and I\nthink we need to think broader and look at the societal aspects. And I really\ncall on you. ","index":"00102","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Certainly,\nI have made many kicks of the can to sit there beside you in the Legislature,\nand it would be my honour to do that, but I don't serve there. I now exist as a\nprivate businessperson and, unfortunately, the most common advice that I have\nto dispense to clients is, you know, you might have a case here but it's not\nworth pursuing: over and over and over again.

If Legal Aid\nManitoba is given a budget that doesn't grow with inflation and doesn't grow\noverall, then that result is it's going to set its priorities different, and\nthat means it's going to not increase eligibility guidelines; it's going to\nlower the amount that it's paying on tariffs; it's going to not fund certain\ncases.
