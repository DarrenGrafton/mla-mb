","index":"00536","speaker":"Wab Kinew"},{"html":"����� So I think that there's a lot of interesting directions. Certainly,\nthe ed review, if it's my understanding, is going to focus a lot on pedagogy\nwithin the classroom, on the way education is delivered, things like that, and\nthen I guess this internal review will be more the way the Department of\nEducation interfaces with the public school system, the K-to-12 system.

They're able to, like, quite\neasily go back and forth between the actual teaching into the classroom towards\nmaybe the theory behind what they're doing, the explaining, you know, the\npedagogy of that, meaning, like, the theory of why their teaching style, their\nteaching technique works.

And so, you know, I think\nit would make a lot of sense that as this internal review is conducted that\nthere be at least some consideration that, you know, having some expertise on\nthe pedagogy be kept within the department, that people working within the\ndepartment do have a good understanding not just of the nuts and bolts�for\ninstance, things like Public Schools Finance Board and delivery of programs�but\nthey also have understanding a bit of the state of the art and state of the\nscience of what works in terms of teaching kids.
