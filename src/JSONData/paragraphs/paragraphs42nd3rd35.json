And what we see is the job growth in\npart-time jobs�low-wage, no-protection, part-time jobs. We see a government\nthat won't stand up and fight for a decent minimum wage or an acceptable wage\nfor working people in this province. We see a government that&nbsp;&nbsp;continues\nto attack organized labour that has provided those protections, those\ngood-paying jobs for Manitobans.

It will make it harder for organized labour\nto speak for those people who they don't represent, which is really what this\ngovernment wants.

","index":"00747","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And this is just one more step in the degradation of those rights\nin this province because, Madam Speaker, this government clearly believes that\nif you're in the class of owners of businesses, you have more rights than if\nyou're in the class of people who work for those businesses.

","index":"00749","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I don't want to spend a whole lot of time bela�bouring what all\nthis government has done wrong with this piece of legislation because it's just\npart of every other piece of legislation that they've introduced that really\nleads us down the wrong path for Manitobans.","index":"00750","speaker":""},{"html":"����� You\nknow, the minister talked about safety and I've touched on it a little bit, but\none of the things in a piece of legislation that disturbed me was his plan to\nhire underage, I guess, superspies to ferret out nefarious wrongdoing and, yet,\nhere we have the minister that is breeding the grounds to encourage that\nnefarious wrongdoing.","index":"00751","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Because\nwe know, from study after study, that for-profit, private liquor sales do not\noffer the same level of oversight for selling liquor to minors, for ensuring\nthat liquor is distributed in a safe manner.

Once privatization occurred, there was a precipitous fall in the\neffectiveness of the liquor tax in the province.
