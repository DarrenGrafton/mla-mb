","index":"00442","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Well, to a certain degree, my understanding is that remote\nwitnessing and commissioning have always been allowed under the provincial\nstate of emergency during a pandemic and this now wants to move to make that\npermanent practice. ","index":"00443","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So when we�when I first read the bill and basically the title of\nthe bill, when it talks about the remote witnessing, I immediately thought of\nmy communities in my constituency, which are primarily remote, and the practice\nthat they have to go through day in, day out for years and generations of being\nable to basically operate remotely to begin with. And so then it raises the\nconcerns that I have with how effective that has been for them up and to this\npoint or�and, contrary to that, how ineffective it has been up to this point. ","index":"00444","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So then it begs the question exactly what this would mean for the\ncommunities, and it's something that they've been dealing with and working with\nfor basically their whole existence, when it comes time to being able to\nwitness and testify in various aspects of the justice system. So when it comes\nto legal�legalese, if that's such a word�to be able to work together and work\nwith our remote communities, it's always proven a lot�to be a lot difficult. ","index":"00445","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I look at this piece of legislation, exactly what that's going\nto do and what that's going to mean and what has worked to this point in our\ncommunities and what�hopefully, this legislation is geared to help fix those\nlittle quirks and things that may not work. ","index":"00446","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So one of the things that I think about is the connectivity that\nour committees would have to be able to do this, and be able to do this in a\nremote way. For myself, for example, I participated virtually in our Zoom\nsessions and I live about two and a half hours, three hours from here. So the\nconnectivity that I had and the issues that I have in a Zoom call�and those of\nyou that are in the Chamber here may have noticed that�on the screen here is\nthat the little lag or sometimes being able to be disconnected, to be able to\nthat. ","index":"00447","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So then when this happens and if we're doing�and we're getting into\nremote witnessing, then I wonder if that would be an issue that we would have.\nWould we have that connectivity issue or lack of, to be able to have people\nparticipate in this kind of setting, whether it be to give evidence, to give\nvirtual testimony or virtual signatures or whatever the case may be, whether or\nnot that would be an actual�something that's a real issue for those communities.","index":"00448","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Because\nwe do have communities, primarily in the North and primarily even with lack of\nconnectivity by road access or what have you, that they may not have the\ninfrastructure to be able to have high-speed Internet, for example, or Internet\nat all, for example. So what would that mean in that case for those communities\nand those people and those organizations, to be able to do that and do it to a\ndegree that everybody else is able to do?","index":"00449","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nwhile this piece of legislation is almost meant to fine-tune a practice that is\nthere and a practice that is currently being done during the pandemic, it begs\nthe question as to whether or not it was fully thought out to the degree as how\ndoes it affect everybody? How does it affect everybody in Manitoba? ","index":"00450","speaker":""},{"html":"����� It may\nbe easy for somebody to connect in St.&nbsp;&nbsp;James or the south end or\nNorth End or east�West&nbsp;&nbsp;End of Winnipeg, to be able to do this,\nbecause they're not able to go down to their lawyer or the court or anything\nlike that to be able to do. But it's a far different scenario for our northern\ncommunities to be able to do that, when remote is possibly the only option. ","index":"00451","speaker":""},{"html":"It's not a secondary option. And, for example, in this case, this is\nalmost deemed as the secondary option due to the pandemic, but for us it's the reality\nthat's existed every day. And there has been a lot of issues with how exactly\nthis goes about every day in our communities and how it best represents what we\ndo.","index":"00452","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We\nhave a number of people in our communities, and not just in my constituency but\nthroughout the North, in particular First Nation communities, that have a\ndifficult time to be able to connect to the remote access and be able to\nparticipate to the fullest extent that they would be in the legal system, just\nfor the lack of connectivity they may have to be able to do that.","index":"00453","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nwhen I think of Bill&nbsp;42 and what the intent of it is, absolutely agree\nwith the intent of it, especially during this time of pandemic and this time of\nCOVID‑19, to be able to limit our communities' and our peoples' travelling\nto and from various urban areas, whether be it the city of Winnipeg or whether\nit be bigger centres or smaller centres, and to be able to do that.","index":"00454","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I\nagree with the premise of the bill and what it's meant to do, and it's meant to\nkind of formally and officially put this in as the first practice rather than\nthe second practice. I do have the concern about being able to actually connect\nour northernmost communities to be able to participate in this. And so if\nthey're not able to participate, what is the means to be able to come back to\nthat and what's the alternative?","index":"00455","speaker":""},{"html":"����� If a\ncommunity member or members or entire community, for that matter, is cut off\nfrom being able to do this and being able to participate, what is their\nalternative? What is their alternative to this?","index":"00456","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Because\nwith remote being the only option here and being now the primary option here,\nso then we ask the question then, what happens in the event that remote does\nnot work for our communities? Because that is an absolute reality for our\nnorthernmost communities, is that remote and�access, whether it be Internet\nconnectivity or whether it be hydro disruptions or whether it be road access,\nis that's something that's a real issue for our communities and being able to\nfully participate, fully represent themselves, and fully be able to come and\nspeak to all the issues that they have.","index":"00457","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So if\nthey're not able to do that then�so if, for example, if we were having a\nconversation over Zoom or over Skype or over the telephone and, for lack of\nbetter term, the remote way of doing it, and I was disconnected, what then\nhappens to whatever situation we were dealing with in that way?","index":"00458","speaker":""},{"html":"����� For\nexample�and when we talk about the following acts�the acts that are amended in\nBill&nbsp;42, let's just take for example The Health Care Directives Act. So if\nsomebody is�we're talking about a power of attorney over being able to have\nhealth-care and medical decisions made on a family member of whoever is making\non the call, whoever is on the one end of the call, and that call gets\ndisrupted, what's the alternative and what works to be able to actually get\nthen the concrete and the correct response, the correct information, from the\nremote access to the point of where that information is supposed to be?","index":"00459","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I\nask, what happens in that case? And in that case, for example, what if we were\nat an end-of-life decision for somebody, and that connectivity is now not\nthere. Who then has that right to be able to say, well, I'm going to make that\ndecision because the phone got hung up, there was a snowstorm and Zoom got\ndisconnected.","index":"00460","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I\ndon't think that's something that's fair, and in this legislation I think that\nneeds to be reflected and addressed to be able to say and to be able to\nfine-tune this to that point where if there is a connectivity issue, what\nexactly is the resolution to that and where do we go from there? ","index":"00461","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(15:10) ","index":"00462","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Because that's just one example. And that may be an extreme\nexample, and we talk about an end-of-life decision for medical personnel, but\nthat's also the real reality to be able to get that and get that information\nand get that correct information, because ultimately�and I know that's the\ndesire on this side of the House and I'm hoping that's the desire on that side\nof the House is to�let's just get this right. So that's the question I have\nthen. Let's get this right.","index":"00463","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So when we talk about being able to connect, being able to, kind\nof, work out the bugs, where is that in this piece of legislation? And again, I\ndo support the premise of the legislation and what the intent is to do, but it\nalso is coming in in regards to the COVID‑19 response. ","index":"00464","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And this is something that's a long-standing issue for a lot of\nnorthern communities in particular being able to deal with prior to COVID. And\nit'll still be an issue following COVID. So this is something that needs to be\nable to addressed, and whether or not that's addressed in this legislation, and\nthat's the connec-tivity of our communities and the actual remoteness. ","index":"00465","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Because I think the definition of remote, by the way it's worded in\nthis bill and in this legislation, is more remote meaning I could be remote\nhere and somebody on the first floor or second floor legislature where we're\nconnecting that way because we're doing that remotely. ","index":"00466","speaker":""},{"html":"����� That's maybe the intent of what this is but, really, the remoteness\nof what we want to be�sometimes the reality is remoteness is 1,000 miles away,\nis miles and miles away: no road, no phone, no Internet. So how do we have that\nconnectivity and how do we create that kind of back and forth to be able to\nrectify those situations.","index":"00467","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So those are things that, in this case, need to be worked out,\nbecause when I made the reference to The&nbsp;Health Care Directives Act, which\nis kind of one of the acts that's amended in this bill, that's just one\nexample. The other example, for example, is The Powers of Attorney Act. So in\nthat case, that also puts a lot of trust�if there's a breakdown in the communi-cation\nand a breakdown in the connectivity�that's putting a lot of trust in the\njustice system to be able to do what's right for whoever may be on the other\nend of that conversation, whoever may be disconnected on the other end of that\nconversation.","index":"00468","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And, quite honestly, Madam Speaker, there is a lot of mistrust\nbetween Indigenous communities and the justice system. So that is something\nthat needs to be addressed is exactly what happens in that break-down, if\nthere's a break in the connectivity between remote access and remote\ninformation being shared and being given back and forth. ","index":"00469","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So that is a real concern as to what happens in that breakdown of\ncommunication in coming forward, and I think that's something that also needs\nto be addressed in Bill 42, especially when it's using the word remote in the\npiece of legislation and being able to say this is how we're going to remotely\ndo things.","index":"00470","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And for all we know, COVID is here to stay, COVID is here for a\nlong period of time, and maybe there's something after COVID that pushes us\neven further to be even more remote, even be less connected to people. And\nmaybe Skype, maybe Zoom, maybe a phone call is the only way we communicate and\nthere is zero communication in person. ","index":"00471","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So in that case, when we talk about The Powers of Attorney Act or\nthe justice system versus that, versus remote, versus talking in court or\nwherever it may be�or being able to do any kind of legal documentation and\ndoing it remotely, doing it over fax, doing it over email�there's a lot of\ntrust that needs to take place there to be able to ensure and feel confident\nthat the fact that the information being given on one end is actually being\nreceived on the other end in the way that it was intended, in the way that it\nis intended by the person that is in fact sending that information remotely.","index":"00472","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So if that person's able to do that, and those are the kind of\nthings that need to be worked out, and the kind of little nuances that need to\nbe fine-tuned in this piece of legislation to be able to say that if there's a\nbreakdown in the remote access and if there's a breakdown in the communication\nor the information's not coming through, if I'm trying to send five pages of\ndocuments to somebody and they only receive four, how do I know which four they\ngot? How do I know which one is missing and the importance of the one that is\nmissing?","index":"00473","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So those are things that need to be addressed and need to be talked\nabout in this, because by doing it this way and doing everything remotely,\nthere is also a lot of trust in being able to know what's going on on that end.\nWe see a perfect example of that over Zoom and over this session that's\ngoing�in place now. ","index":"00474","speaker":""},{"html":"����� For those members that are participating virtually, when you turn\non your microphone, you're assuming that we're all able to hear you. And we've\nalready experienced that�especially over the last two days�that, in fact,\nthere's been some difficulty in that.

Hopefully, the pandemic is over but it\nis my understanding that even when the pandemic subsides�as we know eventually\nwe will beat this thing; we are going to outlast the coronavirus�however, I\nthink some of these changes will be useful for us to have in the legal\nprofession and just in business and in health care and in real estate beyond\nthat, even once the pandemic is over. ","index":"00597","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The other\npoint is that even where we may not be restricted from travelling to a region,\nlike say northern Manitoba, we are all being advised not to travel, and so even\nthough we're maybe not going to get a fine, we are being told, you know, if you\ncan stay off the highway, if you can stay home, don't travel.","index":"00598","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nsimilarly, in any number of these areas, whether it's in providing a\nhealth-care directive, whether it is in appointing a power of attorney, whether\nit is in delegating�or, I should rather say executing, like a real estate\ntransaction, then this piece of legislation would be relevant.","index":"00599","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So an\nexample that comes to mind is Roblin.

But in\nthose conversations, one of the other things that came up, and one of the\nreasons why they were so concerned about the emergency room closure was that\nthey had noticed since the start of the pandemic a lot of folks from outside\nthe immediate area around Roblin now looking at real estate in Roblin.","index":"00600","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so\nthis is part of maybe a broader trend where people in the pandemic were\nstarting to think maybe, you know, if we're going to have to spend more time\ninside, we should look at real estate in which we get more space, in which\nmaybe we have an acreage or, you know, a hobby farm or what have you, maybe\nmore land than that. And so they were seeing I think�now we're going back\ntowards April-May, that early period of the pandemic�people interested in pur-chasing\nreal estate in this part of the Parkland and in this part of the province.","index":"00601","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now,\nif we fast forward to today, you know, again, there was some insecurity there.\nIs the Roblin ER closure going to impact that, and local, I think, officials\nwere concerned that this was turning some people off. People don't want to move\nto the region if there's not going to be health care there. But, hopefully, the\noverall benefits of living in that area, you know, being there close to the,\nyou know, I guess to the parks and to, you know, Asessippi and all those things\nreally is going to lure people to the area.","index":"00602","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But\nthen if that is somebody from say, Brandon, somebody from Winnipeg, how are\nthey supposed to conclude that real estate transaction right now if they're\nbeing encouraged to stay home? Maybe Dr.&nbsp;&nbsp;Roussin would, you know,\nsay like, yes, if you're going to move then, okay, fair enough, you can go do\nthat in person. But I think that this�or some of the powers under this bill\ncould potentially alleviate the concerns both on public health and also on the\nbusiness side of people who want to conclude that real estate transaction.","index":"00603","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nso, just to sum up there, if people were able to, you know, sign on land titles\ndocuments from a distance, as an example, then somebody who is looking to move\nfrom one area of the province might be able to put all their ducks into a row,\nstill abide by the public health advice, and then only have to move and to go\nout in public and leave their home at such a time where they actually were\ngoing to do the actual moving. So I could see how there's an argument here\nwhere allowing Bill 42 to receive royal assent actually, you know, maybe helps\nus on the public health orders and public health advice and just being able to\nabide by those things.","index":"00604","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now,\nunfortunately, we know that there's also a lot of issues that have been\ndirectly caused by COVID that could be affected here.

I do think that just\nmaking that whole process a little bit easier here and just�you know�maybe not\nrequiring the relative who's self-isolating from having to break the\nself-isolation to be able to participate in some of these legal processes might\nmake things a little bit easier.

I guess that's a good theory if we were all highly trained\npension specialists, but many of us are not, and certainly I have had people\ncall my constituency office that got laid off as the result of actions of this\ngovernment. They took an early layoff, took a buyout because they could see the\ndollars and cents that they would get when they withdrew the money from their\npension. Now, they were only allowed to withdraw 50&nbsp;per cent of the funds,\nwhich they did and turned around and bought things thinking that they were\nmaking the right decisions, but then all of a sudden, one day they realized\nthey couldn't make their mortgage payments, they couldn't make the car\npayments, didn't know where their groceries were going to come from because the\namount left in their pension was now not sufficient to sustain their lifestyle,\nso they were having to make some pretty serious decisions.","index":"00727","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Now, I know, for example when I retired from the private\ncorporation that I worked for for 40 years, I knew that the best thing possible\nfor me and for everybody else in the plan was to leave my money in that plan,\nbecause I'm not a financial adviser.
