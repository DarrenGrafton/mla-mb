So when we talk about being able to recognize our reservists, recognize\nour military and thank them for their accomplishments and thank them for their\nservice, not only during times of deployment but also during times when they're\nnot deployed, when they're at home, and their sense of security that they\nshould feel in all aspects of their service to our country, in their service to\nour country to things that we take for granted perhaps every single day.","index":"00695","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And we\ndon't�I can't begin to imagine exactly what a reservist goes through or\nsomebody serving in our military goes through just on a daily basis. For\nexample, if they were in wartime or just on a peace deployment, what they go\nthrough and what they're thinking. ","index":"00696","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nwhat should be at the top of their mind, first and foremost, while they're\neither abroad or while they're at home, they shouldn't have to feel that they,\nin fact, have to worry about their employment or have to worry about things\nthat are going on back home and a sense of security back home, because in the\nmoment, for example, if you're being deployed, they should be able to go and\nworry about, first and foremost, their own health, their own safety.","index":"00697","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But\ncoming home and coming back, we can see these kind of things and these kinds of\npieces of legislation�and I'm referring to Bill 211 which, again, I'm sure the\nintent of it was in good faith and good�had good intentions but, once again, it\nfalls short and it falls short in regards to exactly how it clarifies exactly\nwhat is going to be done to assist, and this piece of legislation, meaning Bill\n211, I feel�as my colleague just echoed�is just there for show.","index":"00698","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nyou do question why, potentially, a bill that does have financial implications\nwas not even spoken to by the Finance Minister in any regard. So it begs the\nquestion, exactly what was the purpose of this? Is this to perhaps just kind of\ncreate a wedge issue and perhaps call out members on opposite sides of the\nChamber to say, what do you mean you don't support the military by not\nsupporting this piece of legislation?","index":"00699","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nit's not something that's not supported on this part�on this side of the\nChamber, it's just something that's simply, again, like other pieces of\nlegislation brought forward by this government, it's just simply not enough.","index":"00700","speaker":""},{"html":"����� When\nthe Premier (Mr. Pallister) gets up and he speaks about reservists, in this\ncase, for example, when one comes to Bill 211, refers to them as hard-working\nManitobans, hard-working Canadians�which nobody doubts. Nobody doubts that\nreservists put their lives on the line and are willing to pay the ultimate\nprice�the ultimate price meaning with their lives for what we may take for\ngranted every day.","index":"00701","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So they are some of the hardest\nworking Americans�the hardest working Canadians and North Americans that are\nout there, and that's something that, on this side of the Chamber, we\nappreciate. So we would like to see them thanked <i>[inaudible]<b> </b></i>as a\ncause of the day, not just in this simple piece of legislation, meaning Bill\n211, and exactly what's done for them today, what's done for them tomorrow,\nbecause there is previous Conservative governments that have been in�I don't\nlike to use the word power, but in government in Manitoba and this just simply\nfalls short.","index":"00702","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I had the opportunity in a PMR\nlast week, I believe it was, to speak about Sergeant Tommy Prince, and�Sergeant\nTommy Prince and the sacrifices that he made for Manitobans, for Canadians, for\nhis community for his people and, specifically in Tommy Prince's case, for\nIndigenous people. And what was there for him while he was gone? What was there\nfor him when he came back? And the fact of the matter is there was nothing.\nThere was nothing there for him.","index":"00703","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So it's\nsimilar to my colleague from Fort Garry when he talked about his family member\nhaving to lie to be able to go and fight for something he believed in; so did\nTommy Prince.","index":"00704","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So the fact of\nthe matter is these people in our military, and there is certain individuals in\nour military�and it's not limited to the member from Fort Garry, his family or\nTommy Prince, by any means�there is a large number of Manitobans, Canadians who\nhave served in the reserves, who have served in our military, and with no\nthought of exactly what the appreciation was going to be for them.","index":"00705","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So when we\ntalk about Bill 211 and being able to show our appreciation, I think it's an\nappreciation that has to go way beyond Bill 211, and being able to exactly show\nour appreciation to what they do in wartime, what they do in peacetime, what\nthey do while they're home, what they do while they're abroad. So there's a lot\nof thank-yous that need to be given out to our members and exactly what they\nneed to do.","index":"00706","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, when we\ntalk about being able to show our appreciation, I think we need to show our\nappreciation with full force and be able to say this is how we're going to\nsupport you. We're not going to support you with a simple matter of, you know,\nhere's some unpaid days or here's some paid days, you don't have to worry about\nyour job, worry about your career. When in fact, how do you support our\nmilitary and how do you support them going forward and how do you support them\nwhen they come home? How do you have some kind of economic support for them?\nAnd not just a matter of a paycheque. ","index":"00707","speaker":""},{"html":"����� How do you\nsupport our�coming back and exactly what they're going to come�and exactly what\nthey're going to do when they come home, and where's that support for them? And\nI find Bill 211, while it addresses it to a certain capacity, it doesn't\naddress it to its full potential that we should be.","index":"00708","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So when we get\ninto talking about Bill 211 and being able to say this is what we're going to\ndo, I find that, on behalf of this government, it's just a token piece to say\nthat�a box they want to check and say, okay, you know what, we support our\nreservists, we're being�done; I'll check that box. But exactly have you truly\nexplored at exactly the capacity of what this bill can do and what it can do\nfor everybody in that regard? And again, I feel it falls short.","index":"00709","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And when we\ntalk about our military and our reservists, as Bill 211 reflects�and there's a\nnumber of aspects of that that there could be reflected on. What about our\nreservists that have come home, that have been home for some time that are\nmaybe�no longer be deployed, that are retired, what's there for them? ","index":"00710","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And I\nabsolutely have to make reference to my passion and my Indigenous issue in this\ncase is to relate that Sergeant Tommy Prince and what didn't happen for him\nwhile he was abroad, what didn't happen for him while he came home, and what\nwasn't there for him.","index":"00711","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Is showing our\nappreciation to a reservist when they return from active duty, when they return\nfrom protecting our way of life, is our way of showing appreciation to make\nthem homeless? To have them look to the street and look to a mission to be able\nto take care of themselves, feed themselves, let alone feed their family? And\nit's something that's not able to be done quite easily.","index":"00712","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So again, I\nfeel this legislation in fact falls very short, and it's unfortunate that this\nlegislation that's brought forth by this government, meaning Bill 211, the\nemployment standards code amendment act, and exactly what that does, it's\nunfortunate.","index":"00713","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So with that, Madam Speaker, I'd like to thank you for the opportunity\nto place a few words on the record here today, and I appreciate the\nopportunity.","index":"00714","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Miigwech.\n","index":"00715","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Madam\nSpeaker:</b> Is the House ready for the question?
