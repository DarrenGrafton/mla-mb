Therefore, should Bill 45 undoubtedly pass to receive full\nassent and eventual proclamation, we as an association shall become bound by\nits provisions and shall work faithfully to implement those mandates and\nrequirements, for no one is above the law, and all are under the law.

","index":"00056","speaker":""},{"html":"����� With\nthe same professionalism and expertise that they have always bestowed upon our\nprovince, our staff at the association have conducted comparative analysis of\nhow provincial teacher bargaining has been operationalized in other\njurisdictions. They have drawn important lessons, models and procedures from\nthe Canadian experience and have brought forward options for further\nconsideration, not as endorsement for Bill 45, mind you, but at all times to\nensure unfettered and unhindered service continuity across any legislative\namendments that may apply to their work. This has been undertaken to guarantee\ntheir ability to remain always responsive to meeting the needs of our\ncommunities. ","index":"00057","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Central\nto the options and procedures that our staff have explored has been the\nrecognition that until otherwise notified, school boards shall remain the\nemploying authority for all teachers. As such, it is critical that any\nbargaining mandate that our staff receive when serving as agent reflect the\ntraditional process that has always been used for everyone's mutual advantage. ","index":"00058","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Staff\nbelieve that, through the establishment of a representative steering committee\ncomprised of re�gional and other interested representatives, such a model would\nstrike a balance between local and provincial bargaining interests, just as\noccurs in every other Canadian jurisdiction, where school boards exercise local\nvoice and local choice, the provincial bargaining process need not diminish\nlocal interests. Rather, it embraces them through carefully con�structed\nstructural mechanisms, as our staff have learned from their counterparts. ","index":"00059","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Should\nthe minister, under Bill 45, thus extend the employee-agent role to MSBA,\nplease note that our staff are more than ready and have investigated the most\npractical way forward in this regard, one that brings all actors together with\nshared purpose to ensure that Manitoba's collective working environ�ment for\nour students, teachers, teaching staff and schools remains agreeable and\nstrong. ","index":"00060","speaker":""},{"html":"����� To\nconclude, what I will say is that in view of the&nbsp; parallel introduction of\nBill 64, The Education Modernization Act, most of what is embodied under Bill\n45 would be rendered inconsistent or to no force or effect upon the assent of that\nother act. As it is not the purpose of this committee to address that bill at\nthis time, I will simply indicate that 10 minutes does not allow for a full\nclause-by-clause treatment of all that is drafted under Bill 45, nor does it\npermit for a cross-referencing of provincial teacher bargaining provisions\nunder both 45 and 64. Many challenges and questions concerning the co-operation\nof both statutes will be immediately noticeable by anyone who reads both\ndrafts. ","index":"00061","speaker":""},{"html":"����� To\nthat end, our tabled written submission will, we believe, serve to provide\nadditional observations pertaining to the specific clauses that appear in\ncurrent form under Bill 45. We reserve our right to address Bill 64 at a later\ndate and at another forum. ","index":"00062","speaker":""},{"html":"����� As has\nalways been true over the course of MSBA's 115-year history of service to\nManitoba, our&nbsp; staff are further available to inform and research any\nmatter or issue of consequence for public edu�cation.

","index":"00064","speaker":""},{"html":"����� As\nstaff in the Department of Education�indeed, at the highest levels of the civil\nservice�are no doubt&nbsp; aware, labour relations is a profession of highly\ntechnical sophistication. This was undoubtedly why MSBA was included under Bill\n45 as a prospective employer-bargaining agent. You are well aware that we did\nnot seek this role ourselves and only came to learn of this intention when the\nbill was initially published.

","index":"00081","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nwhen you consider that, I think for most of my trustee colleagues that are\nacross the province, the local teachers association attends every one of our\npublic board meetings and we have the opportunity to engage with them in formal\nquestions as a matter of&nbsp; the public question period, which is a standing\nitem&nbsp; on every public board agenda, they have the opportunity to publicly\nengage with the board on matters of COVID‑19, you know, recognition of\nthe work that senior administration teams are doing and the like.

I'm the super�intendent of human resources at Lakeshore\nSchool Division, and I have been asked by our board to speak on behalf of our\nregion here tonight on Bill 45.","index":"00095","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, as\na small rural school division, we serve a large, sparsely populated region.\nIt's approximately the geographic area of PEI, and we have about 1,000&nbsp;\nstudents enrolled. And we're acutely aware of both the challenges and benefits\nof being a small entity, and I&nbsp; think it's really led us to having a very\npersonal and unique approach to education in our region. ","index":"00096","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And at\nthe core of our system is our teaching staff, who work really hard to put our\nstudents first every day, and over the past number of decades, our board has\nworked very hard and collaboratively with our local teachers' association to\ndevelop a collective agree�ment that really reflects that relationship we�that\nwe have, as well as the local area.","index":"00097","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so\nthere's certain language in our collective agreement that varies from other\nentities across the province, and we do feel strongly that we want to protect\nour ability to have our voice heard locally. And I think that it was\nappropriate that I followed on the presentation of Alan, who mentioned, kind of,\nthose local needs and local interests. And when you take a look at the\ndifference between a region of our&nbsp; size and our student population versus\nan urban region, there's significant differences in terms of our operational\nand educational needs. ","index":"00098","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nwhile our board agrees that the teacher bar�gaining process can certainly be\nstreamlined, and there could be some efficiencies found there, there are\nconcerns of certain language in Bill 45 that would effectively sideline the\nvoice of rural areas.","index":"00099","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Of particular\nconcern is 99.9, which talks to the voting process for employers organization.\nAnd in this section it lays out the process to follow if voting is required by\nthe employers, and it stipulates that each district will have their voices\nweighted to reasonable effect�reflect the size of the unit of teachers for each\nmember school division or district.","index":"00100","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In\neffect, because of the difference in numbers between urban and rural divisions,\nthe fact that it would go by the number of teachers in each region effectively\nsidelines the voice of rural areas with low populations. ","index":"00101","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nregardless of what system changes may be coming, and I understand, you know,\nthat there are obviously, as Mr. Alan�as Alan Campbell pointed out, there, you\nknow, there's likely some discrepancies here between Bill 45 and Bill 64, but\nwe can say that&nbsp; whatever changes occur to teacher bargaining in the\nfuture, we would strongly recommend that the wording be made in such a way that\nrural areas have a voice in teacher bargaining and that we have an equitable\nsystem of coming to the table. For example, each region could be allocated one\nvote, by virtue of representing a geographical area, and then there could be an\nequal number of votes to the number of regions that are distributed according\nto the number of teachers�so, both a popular voting mechanism as well as a\ngeographic area allotment as well. ","index":"00102","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\njust wanting to highlight that as one of the concerns in Bill 45, and also just\nwanting to highlight that there is significant differences between rural and\nurban areas. And, when we're looking at a single collective agreement being\nproposed for governing all teachers across the province, we need to make sure\nthat there's allowances for those differences.","index":"00103","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Some\nkey examples of that that to kind of paint that picture in a clear light would\nbe transfer agree�ments, for example. So if we're moving a teacher from one\nschool to another school in our region, it's a very different situation than a\ndivision or district that's moving a teacher from one school to another in an\nurban area. And these things need to be reflected in a collective agreement,\nand I believe that it's important that rural areas have a voice in the process.\n","index":"00104","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Mr.\nChairperson:</b> Thank you, Mr. Nikkel, for your presentation, and now we'll go\non to questions.

It seeks to eliminate the rights of teachers to a fair collective\nbargaining system by getting the arbitration process�by gutting the arbitration\nprocess that underpins it.

The disadvantages of provincial\nbargaining far outweigh the benefits. Obviously, it sacrifices issues of local\nimportance for more global ones.

This generation may want to make a difference in a\nchild's life and serve society, but they also want to see the value they're\ngetting; how they are valued, the money and the perks they're being offered\nwill out�weigh the disadvantages of working in the North.

In preparation for this presentation, I took it upon myself to\ntalk to a number of our teachers regarding the impact of Bill 45 and what\nhaving access to fair and open collective bargaining through our union\neffectively has meant to them.

They were liberated to the point where,\nthrough a two-week period, they weren't concerned with matters with respect to\ntheir�the well-being of their family, the well-being of their home.

I've been an educator for the last 19 years and for\nthe past six years spent in school administration as vice-principal and\nprincipal. And my experience has primarily been within a French-immersion\ncontext.","index":"00595","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, my\nprimary concern with Bill 45 and the reason that I registered to present�this\nis my first time ever presenting to a committee�is the ability-to-pay clause,\nwhich we have heard multiple people talk about already. So, this clause, as\nmaintained, will without a doubt negatively impact teachers' salaries, benefits\nand working conditions, and equally as important, the ability to attract new,\nquality teachers to the profession in Manitoba, in particular, within the\nFrench-immersion sector.","index":"00596","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nFrench-immersion sector is a very highly competitive sector in education across\nCanada. And we are in competition, really, for those teachers with other\nprovinces across the country. In my current school, I hired four new\nFrench-immersion teachers this year and three out of the four came from out of\nprovince. The attraction to teaching in Manitoba: our working conditions, our\nbenefits and our salaries, and the trust and respect that teachers receive from\nthe general public�trust and respect, I fear, that we don't actually feel at\npresent from this government.","index":"00597","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I\nthink I heard from Mr. Wiens and a few of the other presenters say something\nsimilar, but the term ability to pay is misleading and could potentially lead\npublics to believe that the cost of educating our youth is just too high of a\nprice to pay.","index":"00598","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Why is\nit misleading? Well, because it is you, the Province, that sets the dollar\namount that you are willing�not able, but willing�to spend on education. It is\nyou that determines the spending priorities within the province. So you decide\nif education funding is a priority and how much of a priority it is. It is you\nthat determines the price you're willing to pay to educate our youth.","index":"00599","speaker":""},{"html":"����� If I\nmake $2,000 and my rent is $1,000 and I go to my landlord at the end of the\nmonth and say, sorry, I just don't have the ability to pay this month, it's\nsimply not true. The truth is I prioritized my spending on something else and\nonly left $800 to pay for the rent. It's not that I didn't have the ability to\npay, it's that I chose to spend it somewhere else. That's the ability to\nplay�ability-to-pay clause in a nutshell.","index":"00600","speaker":""},{"html":"����� As you\nall know, I'm sure, a critical piece of a fair system of bargaining is an\nunbiased, independent arbitration policy. The arbitration process is the only\ndispute resolution process available to teachers during bargaining. We gave up\nthe right to strike in the best interest of our students. We know how\ndisruptive a strike would be to their education. We know how disruptive a\nstrike would be to their parents, to business, to industry. We can all look to\nthe pandemic school closures over the past year as an example of how disruptive\nit is to daily life when schools close.","index":"00601","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And we\ngave up that right to strike and in turn you, the government, agreed to a fair\narbitration process. It is absolutely imperative that this process remain as\nsuch and that this clause is amended or removed to show that.","index":"00602","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I work\nin a division where we haven't had a contract in, I don't know, three or four\nyears. I'm not really even sure at this point anymore how long it's been. And\nwe're not the only division. And again, I think it speaks to priorities and\nvalues and willingness, and it speaks to devaluing of an educator's worth. And\nit's this devaluing that doesn't fill any of us with any measure of confidence\nthat if this bill passes as is, without a fair system of arbitration, that we'd\nsomehow be valued more.","index":"00603","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And to\nbe perfectly honest, it seems in stark contrast to the rhetoric we've heard\ndaily, weekly, about how grateful this government is for the work of teachers\nthroughout the pandemic.

Regrettably, this government has failed to acknowledge\nthat education is an investment that pays for itself in the long run. Public\neducation is a people business. In LRSD, nearly 85 per cent of the school\ndivision's budget pays for the people who are key to ensuring the system\noperates optimally. This govern�ment looks at education funding as numbers in a\nledger, line items to be cut, dollars and cents to be reigned in. I see those\nnumbers in their human form as the people they represent�teachers, educational\nassistants, and school support staff. These people are bread winners for the\nfamilies they support, taxpayers whose taxes serve to replenish our social\nsupport systems, and shoppers whose spending money serves to feed the economy.","index":"00765","speaker":""},{"html":"As a parent\nwith children attending public schools, it angers me that this government has\ncontinually laid siege on the public education system as evidenced by the\nstatements of various school boards across this province.
