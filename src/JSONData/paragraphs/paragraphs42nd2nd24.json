We believe\nthat to be too simple of an understanding of this phrase, and doesn't truly\ntake into account the realities that we have as legislators in the modern\ncontext. So we understand this to be something that must be taken into account\nwithin the context in which the legislator finds himself or herself, but also\nfor members be given the time to consult the relevant authorities, to be given\nthe opportunity to study and to consult the various experts on the matter, as\nthe case may be, as well as to review the evidence that has been compiled on\nthe matter at hand. And in this case, of course, there is significant evidence\nthat I would like to read into the record and ensure that is being fully\nconsidered by yourself.

","index":"00095","speaker":""},{"html":"����� As a\nresult of the acquisition of correct and accurate information by members, it\nmust be taken to account and into consideration in the determination as to\nwhether or not a member has brought their concern forward in that timely\nfashion. Thus, the question of reasonable in this is not fully objective in the\nsense that there is a fixed or a set or a proper amount of time for bringing\nforward the matter of privilege to this House. In fact, what we would argue is\nthat the question would depend both on the objective facts which need to be\nsorted, or whether the information that is required in order to bring forward\nthis claim of a matter of privilege his�has been forthcoming, whether it's been\nmade available in a timely fashion and whether it's understandable or\ncomprehensible for all members to fully sort through. ","index":"00096","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nneither is the question, I would argue, Mr.&nbsp;Deputy Speaker, either fully\nsubjective in this case. It cannot be a question of the speed of each\nindividual member or on their willingness to expend the time to investigate a\nmatter to determine whether a matter of privilege has been brought to this\nHouse in a timely fashion. Obviously, each member has his or her or their own\nresources that they bring to the table that they are able to employ in order to\ninvestigate a matter such as this. But it's also, I think, an understanding\nthat, based on the interests or the concerns of the member, that the timeliness\nwould depend on whether their, again, willingness to expend the time to fully\ninvestigate that matter, and that is, I think, a very important nuance that\ndoes need to be taken into account with regards to these matters. ","index":"00097","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nit's properly understood, then, we would argue, as an intersubjective standard,\nMr. Deputy Speaker; therefore, a standard that must reflect the true\ncapabilities of the members to acquire that information, to bring it forward to\nthis House and taking into account, of course, the demands that this House may\nreasonably make of all members to bring forward matters at the earliest\nopportunity.

We know\nthat the Speaker's view of the matter is clearly of the utmost importance, but,\nmore importantly, interference should not be construed in narrow physical\nterms, and we certainly know this from the work that we do as legislators here\nin this place. We know that interference in this case could be understood as,\nin a discussion of privilege or contempt, that would go beyond that physical\ninterference, say, in this case�and I know you've given us guidance with\nregards to this in the past, Mr. Deputy Speaker�say, on the physical ability of\nmembers to enter the Chamber to occupy their seats and, therefore, to speak.\nThat, of course, would be a very clear indication or a clear execution of\ninterference, and in that case a matter of privilege would be clear.

","index":"00113","speaker":""},{"html":"I would emphasize that last point, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and I believe\nthat speaks most clearly to the argument that I am making here this afternoon.\nThe most important authorities, arguably, apart from the Supreme Court of\nCanada, hold that the provision of misleading information constitutes a breach\nof privileges of members of this House.

And, again, at a time\nwhen members of this House are certainly doing the best that they can within\ntheir own constituencies to work with their constituents when they have\nquestions�whether it's about daycare, about the closure of schools, about\naccess to health-care programs at this time of a global pandemic and of\nCOVID-19; likewise, in this case, where members are also soon to be at the\ncentre, potentially, of questions with regards to flooding and with regards to\npersonal safety and safety of property�that they are going to be most concerned\nabout.

We know that they also indicated that water-related capital would be\ncounted towards the strategic infrastructure budget within this province.\nParks, cottages, camping, all included as part of the strategic infrastructure\nlisted in this province. The Building Manitoba Fund, which of course we know as\nan important fund that�we know that capital grants that are offered through\nthat program are vitally important to building our province.

They included public service buildings,\nthey included equipment and, again, they included technology. So there was a\nmuch broader definition of what was called strategic infrastructure.

So that was within that\nfirst year, Mr. Deputy Speaker. However, they weren't done yet, because if we\nlook at what they called their mid-year financial report and then look at the\nthird quarter financial report from this year, once again the parameters have\nchanged and once again this government's definition of what's called strategic\ninfrastructure has completely changed.
