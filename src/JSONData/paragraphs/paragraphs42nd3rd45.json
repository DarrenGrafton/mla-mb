","index":"00387","speaker":"Wab Kinew"},{"html":"����� You know, if you were to ask anybody, if we were to ask ourselves\nwhat lessons have we learned throughout COVID‑19 this past year, I think\na few common themes would come to the surface. We'd probably hear about the\nimportance of health care, particularly here in Manitoba. We saw last fall that\nas a result of successive years of cuts to our health-care system, that it was\nonly the heroic efforts of nurses and doctors who kept our emergency rooms and\nhospitals functioning.","index":"00388","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We saw, at the same time, that even though many of us know the\nimportance of the health-care system and recognize how valuable it is to have\nhealth care close to home when you need it, that it's also an economic and a\nsocial issue. When our health-care system is on the verge of being overrun,\nthen the economy came screeching to a halt and there were tremendous impacts on\nsocial and mental health dimensions of our society as well.","index":"00389","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And yet, what was the government's response? The government's\nresponse after a year of the pandemic was to cut funding in terms of real\ndollars delivered in health care at the bedside. That means less resources in\nthe coming year than there were last year to care for patients at the bedside. ","index":"00390","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So after cutting health care for many years, after having to bring\nour economy to a screeching halt because of the pandemic, the government\nresolved, you know what, we should have less people working in the health-care\nsystem delivering direct patient care to Manitobans. ","index":"00391","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Clearly, they did not learn the lesson of the importance of health\ncare, not just to the health and well-being of Manitobans, but also to our\neconomy, society and to our collective mental health.","index":"00392","speaker":""},{"html":"����� One of the big issues that we saw throughout the pandemic was\nalso�not just in Manitoba, but everywhere�the impacts on seniors living in\nlong-term-care homes. We saw in the first wave, in provinces like Ontario and\nQuebec, that long-term-care homes were very vulnerable, and we had very tragic\nloss of life. Many seniors perished.","index":"00393","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Unfortunately, even though we knew that that was coming, the\ngovernment failed to put in place proactive measures to protect seniors in\nlong-term care, and we saw a disastrous outcome, unfortunately, in care homes\nlike Maples, Parkview Place, Charleswood and, sadly, many others. ","index":"00394","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And yet, after seeing that impact, what was the government's\nresponse? The government's response was to freeze funding for personal-care homes.\n","index":"00395","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The government, through its actions in this year's budget, is\nsaying that the same amount of care in personal-care homes as was there last\nyear, according to them, is the right amount. And we say that's wrong. ","index":"00396","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We saw what happened with that amount of investment last year, and\nI had thought that we as a society all banded together in November and December\nto say, we're going to fix this thing, we're going to improve personal-care\nhomes as one of the lasting legacies of the pandemic. ","index":"00397","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But, apparently, those were just empty words for the members\nopposite, because what they are doing in this budget is guaranteeing that there\nwill be less staff time, less time with a nurse, less time with a health-care\naide for every senior living in a personal-care home in Manitoba because\nthey've frozen the funding and then they're forcing that money to go further\nand cover more patients in more beds.","index":"00398","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So simple math would tell you that the situation is going to, at\nthe very least, not improve, and probably is going to get a lot worse. The\nsolution, of course, would be to invest to ensure that there's more health-care\naides and nurses who can deliver that direct care to patients. ","index":"00399","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We also see that there's many issues with the education system. The\ngovernment has�well, being honest here, already being pretty unpopular at the\nmoment�decided to devote a significant amount of their remaining political\ncapital towards trying to implement a plan with Bill&nbsp;64 to cut the\neducation system. Then we saw in the budget that despite all the&nbsp;fanfare\nand rhetoric that Bill&nbsp;64 was announced with, that their real plan is to\ncontinue underfunding the K-to-12 system here in Manitoba.","index":"00400","speaker":""},{"html":"����� If that weren't bad enough, the Premier (Mr.&nbsp;Pallister)\ndecided to go out and insult teachers by asking that they pay to cover the\nschool supplies to teach children in their classrooms as a result of the\nunderfunding that his government has perpetrated on the system. ","index":"00401","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We were in question period when the members opposite were clapping\nfor their leader as he doubled down on that misguided approach, but at the same\ntime, CBC published the story whose headline said that teachers are insulted\nand disgusted by the First Minister's suggestions. And rightfully so.","index":"00402","speaker":""},{"html":"����� It is truly bizarre that a government would try and ask\nteachers�whose wages they have froze for some five years now�to dip into the\nshrinking pool of disposable income that they have to buy school supplies that\nthe public system should be furnishing for those children.","index":"00403","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Of course, when we look at the post-secondary system, there is a\ncut in terms of even nominal dollars�not just real dollars, but there's a\nnominal dollar cut�of more than $8&nbsp;million, almost $9&nbsp;million. That's\nless investment in young Manitobans who are seeking to expand their horizons\nand lay the foundation for a good career.","index":"00404","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so, certainly there are many challenges in this budget. And we\nalso note the failure to rectify the ongoing fiasco of this government's\nmismanagement of Manitoba Hydro. Simple request from IBEW workers was to get\nout of the way and let them negotiate a fair deal.","index":"00405","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The Premier, the ministers, had an opportunity to do so in\nyesterday's budget and they failed to avail themselves of that opportunity. And\nso a strike continues.","index":"00406","speaker":""},{"html":"����� At the same time, we know that this costs Manitobans millions of\ndollars a day. And so, one of the failures of the government in this budget is\nfor them to fail to disclose to Manitobans just how much they plan to raise\ntheir electricity rates by, in the coming year. ","index":"00407","speaker":""},{"html":"����� They did it in December�in the middle of the pandemic, they made\nlife more expensive�and now they will choose to do so again, perhaps in this\nyear's&nbsp;&nbsp;BITSA bill, perhaps in a stand-alone piece of legislation, or\nperhaps they will just wait until November, after their Bill&nbsp;35 passes,\nand then decide to raise rates by a order-in-council. ","index":"00408","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But whatever approach they take to bypass the Public Utilities\nBoard, one thing we can conclude is that it is wrong. Manitobans deserve to\nhave a fair and open public hearing to determine the impact of the billions of\ndollars of export contracts that the Premier has concealed from the light of\nday.","index":"00409","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Manitobans deserve to have a fair and partial hearing that would\nshed light onto the true nature of&nbsp;&nbsp;the financial health of the\ncorporation so that the&nbsp;workers�among many other stakeholders�could under�stand\nwhat a fair deal might look like and what a fair rate to be set could, in fact,\nbe.","index":"00410","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So there are many issues with the Province's budget, and I am going\nto move an amendment that highlights our displeasure and begins to list some of\nthe many failures that this government has.
