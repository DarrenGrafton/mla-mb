Cannabis currently is on\na�the same track. It has a public-private partnership, a wholesale public and\nretail private. It's a model that, quite frankly, is looked at as one of the\ntop models throughout Canada. ","index":"00656","speaker":"Jeff Wharton"},{"html":"As the member knows, the Liberal government of the day rushed through\nthe legalization of cannabis and put, quite frankly, every jurisdiction in\nCanada in a very, very difficult situation.

","index":"00658","speaker":""},{"html":"<span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">����� </span>So, quite frankly,\nI think the member would agree that, in light of the federal 'libbelor'\ngovernment essentially saying, look, it's opening on October 1 whether you like\nit or not, I think Manitobans responded 'admirally'.

So that was\nhardly a rush. ","index":"00660","speaker":"Dougald Lamont"},{"html":"<span style=\"mso-tab-count:1\">����� </span>But the question is serious, though. I\nunderstand that there were�was a different proposal, a different model that\nwould have meant that MBLL had $95&nbsp;&nbsp;million instead of the current\nlevel, which, I believe, is under $5 million in revenue right now. ","index":"00661","speaker":""},{"html":"And one of the issues\nis also the question of ownership, whether�who is benefiting from the profits,\nright, is that in these public and private ownerships is that a fairly small�is\nthat a fairly large number of the businesses involved to�are not Manitoba-owned\nor -operated, so that we're actually seeing profits, taxes and so on leave the\nprovince when we could have been seeing a much higher level.
