In the context of a pandemic, it can be expected that a sig�nificant\nnumber of voters will be unable to attend a polling station as they need to\nself-isolate or they may simply prefer, and reasonably prefer, to limit\nexposure by avoiding crowds and public places.

The City of Winnipeg Charter currently states that\nelection day will be the fourth Wednesday of October every fourth year. The No.\n1 citizen concern we have raised in regard to elections is the concern for\nchildren's safety as a result of having elections in schools.

Having\nby-elections on Saturdays relieves the fears mentioned because children are not\npresent. As well, turnout is increased for by-elections held on Saturdays\nversus those held during the week, as citizens tend to have more time\navailable. Many citizens have a larger window of time available to them to\nvote, and this spreads out the flow of voting at election locations. Reduced\nlineups and swift voter processing makes for a more positive voter experience,\nand it is also easier to attract workers. ","index":"00166","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nProvince of Manitoba did also recognize some of these same concerns for\nchildren's safety and changed The Elections Act recently to ensure that class�es\ncould be cancelled in schools where provincial elections are taking place.","index":"00167","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Municipal\nelections on weekends are common in Canada, including in BC, where municipal\nelections are on a third Saturday in October, and Quebec, where elections are\non the first Sunday in November.","index":"00168","speaker":""},{"html":"����� When\nwe have raised this issue in the past, the response has been that we should not\nuse schools for elections at all.

The intent of the legislation of the code of conduct\nis to promote appropriate behaviour and to encourage reconciliation and\nco-operation among members of council.

If the person is not receptive, then a complaint may be\nfiled with the CAO. The complaint must be within 30 days of the violation\nunless it's�sexual harassment takes place. Then it is sent to a third party\nintake reviewer; the reviewer sends a report back to the council with a\nrecommenda�tion of dismissal or acceptance of the complaint. Even if the\nrecommendation is dismissal, council can vote that the complaint be moved to\nmediation.</span>","index":"00259","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� Additionally,&nbsp;if the complaint is accepted, it also moves\nto mediation.

Once the investigation is complete, outcomes of the\ninvestigation are voted on by council. </span>","index":"00260","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� Throughout this entire process, any votes by council are\npassed by the majority. You can see that the process is geared towards to the\nmajority on council.

While informal resolution must be sought at\nthe beginning of the complaint, a CAO can accept the complaint and send it to\nthe intake reviewer without informal resolu�tion, even though this is not\nproper process. The com�plaint is sent to the intake reviewer and is returned\nto council to be dismissed because of lack of informal resolution. However, a\nmajority on council can vote for the process to continue, despite the fact that\nthe first step has not been followed. There is nothing that the respondent can\ndo in this regard if they are not part of the majority. </span>","index":"00262","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� Next, the\ncomplaint moves to mediation to try and resolve problems. If the complainant or\nthe respon�dent refuse to mediate, the complaint moves to in�vesti�ga�tion�even\nif one party is willing, mediation is not considered.

If the CAO is unbiased they should be asking both\nparties for the requests. However, if the one party refuses mediation, it\nleaves the CAO�who may or may not be unbiased�to choose an investigator. This\nis also problematic. What should happen is if the two parties cannot agree, a\nthird unbiased party that is at arm's-length from the municipality should\nchoose an investigator, rather than the CAO�someone like an intake reviewer.\nThis allows an unbiased decision and allows the CAO to be free of allegations\nof bias. </span>","index":"00264","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� Investigations can also be biased if the investi�gator relies\non management for information.

The investigator should rely on the\ninformation they are given and balance their approach to witnesses. They should\ninterview witnesses from both sides of the complaint.</span>","index":"00265","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� Nevertheless, once the investigation is complete, if the\ninvestigation finds the respondent has not contravened the code, no sanctions\ncan be imposed.

I understand that the association for\nManitoba municipalities, they have to talk their book there of what they want\nto see, but taking away the decisions from the local authorities and this idea\nof taking away some local autonomy, I mean, it is the fundamental reason why\nthis bill has to happen. And I'll just tell you my own story and my experience,\nand you can see why I have that opinion. ","index":"00361","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I\nwant to address the�Bill 37, specifically the provisions and the ability for an\napplicant, the way I understand it, to appeal a development agreement. ","index":"00362","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nthe way I read this bill, it says that the municipality has to produce a\ndevelopment agreement within 90 days, and also that there are some grounds\nunder which you can appeal your actual development agreement. So, the terms and\nconditions in that, and I would suggest that that has to be as broad as\npossible because the municipalities do not use a standard develop�ment\nagreement and they change the terms all the time�terms and conditions. ","index":"00363","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nI'll just give you a little bit of background quickly on our story, our\ndevelopment here. We signed the development agreement in March of 2013 with the\nRM of West St. Paul, and our main parcel of&nbsp;property is from Main Street\nto the Red River. And&nbsp;&nbsp;just for perspective, we border the Shooters\ngolf&nbsp;&nbsp;course<b> </b>on one side, so we're technically about 100&nbsp;metres\noutside the northern city boundary on Main Street, so we're well inside the\nPerimeter, and, in fact, you wouldn't even know it was the RM of West St.&nbsp;Paul,\nbecause there's continuous develop�ment there.","index":"00364","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Anyway,\nour river portion was zoned multi-family, and when we signed this development\nagreement, we did not have our river portion design concept for it. So, the\nfront part of our property we were going to develop and this back part, which\nwas zoned multi-family, we were going to develop at a later date. ","index":"00365","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And so\nwithin this development agreement there was a clause that said we needed to\nprovide and if�just bear with me, I'll just read this�a detailed plan of\ndevelopment showing all structures to be constructed, including the number of\ndwelling units; how drainage, landscaping, protection of existing trees and\nvegeta�tion, traffic flow including internal roadways, connec�tion to a sewer\nsystem and water supply and flood�proofing are being dealt with, and�all of\nwhich must be to the satisfaction of the municipality. The munici�pality and\nthe developer will enter into a supplemental development agreement dealing with\nall of the above. ","index":"00366","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nit's fairly straightforward that this is, you know, a development. You would do\na site plan and an elevation and then you'd have your engineers do a servicing\ntrial. So there's nothing unusual in what this is; this would be done within a\ncouple months of when we're ready to proceed. ","index":"00367","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nwhat happened here was this original develop�ment agreement we signed covered\nall the infra�structure we needed for our development, so all of the roads, the\ncurbs and gutters, the sewer, the water, every��thing was covered under our\ndevelopment agree�ment. And, in fact, we brought all the servicing to this\nmulti-family site, even though we weren't ready to develop it yet; we stubbed\neverything to this property because we were going to develop it in the future. ","index":"00368","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, to\nbe clear, we have a parcel here that's al�ready zoned multi-family, it's\nserviced, everything is stubbed to the site, it's just bare land sitting there,\nand we want�and it's zoned multi-family and it's zoned for 179 units. And so we\nhad everything ready to go and everything is done sort of ahead of time so that\nwhen we wanted to develop it, we just needed to meet these conditions of a\nsupplemental development agreement. ","index":"00369","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, in\n2014, we decided we were going to do a townhouse development, and we had to get\na sub�divi�sion approved; we had to get a supplemental develop�ment agreement\ndone. This whole process took about two years. And it went fine, I guess. ","index":"00370","speaker":""},{"html":"����� At the\nend of a two-year�so now we're in about March 2016 and we had a development\nagreement ready to sign, and we've been billed about $11,000 to date for the\nRM's cost for creating this development agreement. And the market had changed.\nThere were some things in the development agreement we didn't like that created\na lot of risk for us to proceed with the project, so we decided we were going\nto walk away from that concept and let it lapse�because the sub�division\napproval has a time limit and then it lapses. So we said, well, we're just\ngoing to lapse and we'll do something different. ","index":"00371","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nthat was in�so that was basically five years ago. So the point I want to make\nhere is that since that date, we have not been able to get a supplemental\ndevelopment agreement from the RM of West St.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul. In five years,\nthey have not been able to provide us a development agreement�five\nyears�because we changed the concept. ","index":"00372","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So we\nwent to a concept that was already approved; it's already allowed for in the\nzoning, and that's an apartment building. We said, why don't we just do an\napartment building? We don't need any variances, we don't need any subdivision;\nwe'll just design it�that meets all the zoning requirements. ","index":"00373","speaker":""},{"html":"����� We\npresented it to the RM, and in five years they have not produced a development\nagreement and we've been billed $50,000 in legal fees from the RM, $50,000 in\nlegal fees. So we have no development agreement, we have giant legal bills that\nwe paid, and they still cannot produce a development agreement for us, even\nthough we had one five years ago that was ready to sign; it just needed to be\nmodified for a new design. ","index":"00374","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>*</b>\n(19:30)","index":"00375","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nthat gets to the point about having a timeline and some independence\nhere�somebody outside of the RM who says, hey, you guys need to produce this development\nagreement. ","index":"00376","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But\nthen I also want to talk about that the develop�ment agreement, you have to be\nable to have some independent review process if you get a development agreement\nthat's not fair. And what happens here is there's no�there's a process in the\nRM now where you can�an independent person can request copies of develop�ment\nagreements. ","index":"00377","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nwe've got eight, nine, 10 development agree�ments up�have been done in the RM,\nso we know what clauses they give other developers. And the draft development\nagreement we've given is�we've been given by them is significantly more onerous\nand more punitive than what they give to everybody else. We haven't�and there's\nno appeal mechanism. So I want to say this and I want to make this clear, is\nthat the RM�and the first speaker talked about local autonomy and things like\nthat�the RM is the judge, jury and executioner here in this process. ","index":"00378","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nlet me just give you an example here. So, with respect to development fees, in\nmost of these develop�ments�large developments�the RM offers to other\ndevelopers and says, pay your fees, pay 50&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of your fees when\nyou get a building per�mit and pay 50&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent when you get an\noccupancy permit. So that seems fairly reasonable. And in our development\nagreement it says, pay 100&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the fees when you sign the\ndevelopment agreement. ","index":"00379","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So, in\nour case, when�if we sign a development agreement, we have to write a cheque\nfor $1&nbsp;million up front and our building is going to take two years plus\nto build, so that the terms are substantially more beneficial to somebody else.\nAnd it's not unusual, because we've seen a whole bunch of development\nagreements, but they've just decided to make us suffer, I guess�I don't know\nwhy, but to suffer.","index":"00380","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Let me\ngive you another example. We went through a draft development agreement they\ngave us with our lawyer and we pointed out 13 things�significant things�that\nwere inconsistent with other development agreements that they're writing with\nother developers. And their response to our 13 things was no to everything. So\neverything we pointed out and said, you know, here's three development agree�ments\nyou just signed, and here's what you put in those ones, and here's the same\nclause and here's how you've changed it and make our agreement and our clause\nsignificantly more adverse than you're giving other developers.

","index":"00383","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I just\nwant to point out one final thing in this development agreement. There's also a\nclause in there that says, oh, and if you sign this, you're agreeing to\nindemnify the RM for any actions they might have taken in giving�in leading up\nto this development agreement. So they can abuse you for five years and then\nthe only way you can get this development signed is if you give them an\nindemnification that you have no recourse against them. ","index":"00384","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nfor all of those reasons, I am suggesting that Bill 37 has to have some teeth\nin it that takes away the ability for the RMs to abuse property owners.

Our municipality supports econo�mic\ndevelopment and residential growth. Popula�tion growth in our community in\nrecent years was 8.8 per cent, which is higher than the provincial average of\n5.8 per cent and the national average of 5&nbsp;per cent.

We take into consideration the impact to our\nstaff, to residents, businesses and developers.

","index":"00647","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nfirst concern relates to a possible loss of autonomy. In the current bill, the\nregional planning board composition is unclear. It does not clarify if the\nappointed 'boid'�board members are elected officials, if they can be municipal\nstaff or community members. We believe this issue can easily be addressed and\nclari�fied in the regulations. Municipal council mem�bers and CAOs are most\nfamiliar with strategic plans, development goals for their own community and\nthe region as well as resident concerns within our communities. We want to make\nsure all of those stake�holders are represented by having a member of council\nor CAO be appointed to the new regional board by resolution of their respective\ncouncil. That is currently not clear.

Costs related to this new regional planning board include unknown\noperating costs as part of board membership. We are concerned about the costs\nassociated with Municipal Board appeal hearings. Historically, each time the RM\nof West St.&nbsp;Paul has come before the Municipal Board for an appeal, it has\ncost our municipality a minimum of $5,000, never mind the time it has taken our\nstaff and legal to prepare.

Significant costs to the RM will be legal fees, time spent, staff\nhours. There are also significant costs associated with changing our zoning\nbylaws to align with the new regional plan. I would ask at this time that the\nprovincial government consider providing municipalities with unlimited grants\nto help offset some of these costs that we will have to have to mitigate these\nchallenges.","index":"00650","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Another\nconcern we have is in regard to the require�ment that a written reason\naccompanying coun�cil decisions are provided around the land-use plan�ning.

The RM&nbsp;of West St. Paul does not believe all decisions should\nbe open to appeal by applicants, particularly con�ditional-use and variance\napplication. By their very nature, these planning applications are requests to\nallow uses that run counter to the established con�ditions outlined in our\nlocal zoning bylaws, which is to reflect the land-use designation identified in\nthe regional plan. It is our belief that these applications should not be\nsubject to appeal, as they run counter to the regional plan.

This\nmecha�nism for appeal already exists. Conditions added by council can also be\nappealed through the courts.

The most important piece of the puzzle, I think. Timely and\ncritically important because we are again reaching an inflection point similar\nto where we were back in 2001. Again, we must decide. We have enough\neconomically serviceable ground in Winnipeg for about eight to&nbsp;10&nbsp;years.\nAfter that, it will run out and it will become very expensive to bring some of\nthe other land on stream.

If we make that choice, we will drive up the cost of housing and the\ncost of doing business in the province.","index":"00879","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I've\nworked on this file for about 30 years now.

","index":"00980","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Bill\n37 will be broadening the range of appli�cations that can be appealed to\nMunicipal Board, as well as the types of appeals that can be filed, such as\ninstances where an application has not been brought forward within a specific\ntime frame. An application is appealed to Manitoba Municipal Board; the board\nhas the full authority to choose to approve or reject an application or\nrecommend it there. This means that there are decisions being made, potentially\nwithout the input of local elected officials but also without local residents\nhaving an opportunity to provide input or even be notified.","index":"00981","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In\nplanning, local knowledge is a vital part of the decision-making process. It is\nhow we determine what is in the public interest, that complicated and often\nmessy synthesis of public opinion, public good and public need. ","index":"00982","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Effectively,\na few rules being implemented through Bill 37. There are two sets of rules\nbeing created: a set of rules for the Municipal Board, which does not mandate\nthat notification be sent to local residents; and those for municipalities,\nwhich requires a very specific notification process to residents, which, if\nviolated, often winds up in court or having to repeat an appeal process or a\npublic-hearing process, rather. ","index":"00983","speaker":""},{"html":"����� There\nis a solution to this problem and, simply put, for applications that are being\nsent to Municipal Board that have not yet had a public hearing before a\nmunicipal or city council, require that that Municipal Board hearing go through\nthe same public-notification process as outlined in the Manitoba Planning Act.\nThis means notices on the property or mail-outs to property owners within 300\nfeet of the property.","index":"00984","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nprocess for public-hearing notification should not&nbsp;&nbsp;change,\nregardless if it is going to the Manitoba Municipal Board or to a local council.\nPeople have the right to be notified and to have a say in what's happening in\ntheir community.

Under\nBill 37, it is possible for applications to go through Manitoba Municipal Board\nwithout a public hearing being held at the local level, which means that a\nplanner may not even have had an opportunity to complete a report to council,\nmuch less the Municipal Board. ","index":"00987","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Planners\nbring a unique perspective and under�standing to land development and the\nimpacts it will have on the social and economic and environmental fabric of our\ncommunities. There is already provisions in The Municipal Board Act that state\nthat technical staff may be appointed to assist in certain matters, and perhaps\nit's time to either broaden that or consider enacting that on a permanent\nbasis, requiring that planners be involved in the Municipal Board pro�cesses\ninvolving planning applications. ","index":"00988","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\nsecond area I wish to discuss tonight is the idea of combined site development\napplications. Now, we've heard a bit of mention of this already as this is a\nprocess that exists in Winnipeg that is not afforded to the rest of Manitoba.\nBill 37 focuses on appeals as a means of improving development processes. I\nfind this to be primarily a stick. And, certainly, appeals can be an important\nprocess of the development standards in ensuring a fair process has been gone\nthrough, but it's not a tool that should be used permanently or as the only\ntool available. There are other options such as combined site development\napplications. ","index":"00989","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nright now in rural Manitoba, if you want to develop a piece of land, it might\nbe required that you go through a rezoning process, subdivide the property and,\nif necessary, obtain variances and conditional-use approvals. Each of these\nsteps requires a separate application, a separate decision from council, which\nmeans a separate resolution and, depending on the application, potentially\nseparate public hearings, isolated from one another. ","index":"00990","speaker":""},{"html":"����� With\nthe new appeals processes being introduced in the proposed changes, this also\nmeans that there can potentially be separate appeal hearings for each of these\nitems being brought forward. That's a separate appeal for rezoning, a separate\nappeal for subdi�visions, a separate appeal for conditional uses and then\nseparate appeals for development agreements. And it should be noted that\ndevelopment agreements are different, do have some different requirements for\nitems that can be included as part of zonings and subdivisions; they are not\nthe same requirements. ","index":"00991","speaker":""},{"html":"����� As you\ncan imagine, this creates a incredibly complicated set of procedures and\ndecision-making processes where, depending how applications have been made, an\napplication to rezone a property may not include discussion of how the lots\nwill be created as part of the subdivision process. And during those appeal\nprocesses and appeal hearings, you can't talk about the subdivision or appeal\non a rezoning application. ","index":"00992","speaker":""},{"html":"����� This\nis a�councils are forced to navigate compli�cated legal procedures from the\norder in which decisions are made. Often, approval of an application is\nconditional on the approval of another application. It's a muddy, complicated,\nbureaucratic process that is often not even necessary and is far from\ntransparent for the public. By including this for rural Manitoba, especially\nfor those areas in which Plan20-50 is expecting and requiring higher density\ndevelopment, it will be imperative that we have better tools to implement\ndevelopment faster, more equitably and more transparently for the public. ","index":"00993","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Combined\nsite development applications allow us to undergo the single process for\nrezoning subdivisions and other types of approvals.
