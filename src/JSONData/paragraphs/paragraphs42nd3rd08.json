Because it\nmade no sense to me to�I understand why we sent the infected people away from\nthe hospitals. In the case of Italy, we had many doctors infected, and nurses\ninfected, because they didn't understand at that time that it was not a good\nidea to send the infected people into the hospital environment. You had to\nprotect the hospitals, protect the doctors, protect the nurses. So what we did\nwas an improvement over that.

We sent them home. And Chris\nCuomo's a good example�the governor of New York's brother, who's on CNN every\nnight�got infected and he did his show, live. And you notice, at the time that\nhe did it, he stayed in his own house, where�and he's in the basement.

We have a facility that we have a number of people in and have had\nthem in for a number of months now. There's one on Sargent Avenue, where people\nthat are homeless are put in this facility. </span>There is also another\nfacility�I&nbsp;&nbsp;think it's a hotel�that was quietly announced back in the\nbeginning of the pandemic, where people who don't present a proper plan to the\nhealth authorities are put in there.

There's about six or eight\nof them now that are in stage 3 trials in the States and I think there's only\none that have�has an efficacy at 50 per cent like the normal flu that I got�flu\nshot that I got on Saturday.

He tested every week for a month and then they said,\ndon't come back anymore because you are�you're not�you don't have enough\nantibodies, okay. His wife had enough antibodies for only three months.

This should give us cause for a lot of happiness that this thing is\ngoing to be, you know, at the same time as the Spanish flu was finished in 26&nbsp;months,\nbefore that time here we're going to have proper vaccination program if we can\nconvince everybody to take the darned things, right, you know. </span>","index":"00578","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">����� But I can see that happening because, you know,\nairlines won't let you fly unless you have a vaccination certificate and I'm\nsure that the, you know, the professionals, the medical professionals will take\nit.

You know what happened\nin the Spanish flu 100 years ago, the reason why they did die in 26 months. Why\nwas it dead? You know why?
