Certainly, due to conflict of interest considerations, the funding\ncould not come from the regulator. It is also important to recognize that there\nmay not be sufficient numbers of internationally educated applicants in certain\nsmaller professions, and that would make an operation of such a program\nunsustainable.","index":"00059","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Our\nfourth point is in regard to section 15.2: By March 1st of each year, a\nregulated profession must prepare and submit to the director an annual report\nfor the 12-month period ending December 31st on the registration of\ninternationally educated individuals, and the report must include any other\ninformation requested by the director.","index":"00060","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Currently,\nregulators must submit various data to the Fairness Commissioner by March of\neach year.

The Regulated Health\nProfessions Act, which does or will in future govern regulated health\nprofessions, requires regulators of health professions to serve and protect the\npublic interest. It would be difficult for regulators to knowingly set aside\ntheir regulatory mandate to serve and protect the public interest if it were in\nconflict with a labour mobility provision, as the interests of their economics\nand health care do not always intersect. ","index":"00069","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Further,\nregulators are concerned about an accountability to two ministers and the\npotential issues that might arise if the objectives of the two departments do\nnot align. This concern is heightened in light of the new compliance order\nprovision.

That doesn't give us a lot of time to put the\neffort and energy into looking at each of these concerns that we've raised\ntoday and determine if there are alternatives or if we have suggestions for\nchange.

","index":"00092","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Ms.\nStansfield:</b> This is a very important part of our submission, and we\nrecognize that there are larger and smaller regulators and as there are health\nprofessions that have greater and larger numbers of registrants. If I can speak\nfor a moment from the perspective of the College of Registered Nurses, as the\nlargest, in terms of numbers of registrants, we are able to provide the volume\nof applicants to a bridging program that is able to sustain a program that does\nprovide that level of support to internationally educated applicants. And, as you\nknow, regulators are not supported by provincial funding, so all of our funding\ncomes from applicants.","index":"00093","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nthat program is self-sufficient simply because of the volume. However, there\nare many other regulators that have, in fact, you know, hundreds of registrants,\nrather than thousands, as we do. And it is just not possible for those\nregistrants to bear the cost of a fully funded bridging program for\ninternationally educated applicants. ","index":"00094","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Therefore,\nthere would have to be some other sources of funding available. Nor is it\nappropriate for a regulator to actually fund such a program, simply because the\ndistance between the regulator and the process by which an applicant determines\ntheir competence needs to be very clearly distinguished.","index":"00095","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nthere is really very little that a regulator legitimately can do to develop or\nsupport financially a program that eventually is producing applicants that must\nprovide their compliance or demonstrate their competence to the regulator.

One of the questions we asked during our\nconsultation with IEPs was: If they could go back in time and tell themselves\none thing about coming to Manitoba, what would it be? A common response we\nheard was that they could tell themselves anything, it'd be not to move to\nManitoba.

But more\noften, when they are here, they are not deemed competent to work here. We all\nknow that. Assessing the credentials of the national educated professionals\ncomplex challenging, but crucially important.

They have also to ensure that their practices are\ntransparent, objective, impartial and fair. The question we need to find\nsolution to links to our�the real motive behind why some regulators are not\nfair, why they are not impartial. I don't want to, you know, argue English\nlanguage proficiency tests should have lifetime validity without any barriers.\nBut regulatory bodies in Manitoba typically use international standards for\ndescribing English language ability.

Can we claim\nour education certificate has lifetime validity as far as we renew our licence\nfor every year?

Have you ever worried that you missed\na chance at being accepted into a grad or Ph.D. program because your undergrad\ndegree has an expiration date?

Why most of the\nregulatory bodies use international English language testing system, IELTS? To\nserve as doors, door openers and gatekeepers.

Any serious attempt to fix the problem of credential\nrecognition must include direct attention to a number of factors.

International\neducated engineers qualification program, IEQ program, that's the Canadian\nlanguage benchmark placement test. Students can request a waiver of the English\nlanguage proficiency requirement. Students from 17 countries are exempt English\nlanguage requirement. So, in addition to adopting this in other existing policy\npractices, regulatory bodies can expand their criteria for language\nproficiency, such as more options for IEPs.

Each of those components is critical to\nour fundamental role to regulate lawyers in the public interest. ","index":"00366","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\namendments insert the government into the process of governance of the legal\nprofession, and this represents a departure from a long-standing regulatory\nframework where the Law Society independently regulates in accordance with its\nstatutory purpose. ","index":"00367","speaker":""},{"html":"����� The\ndependence of lawyers and the regulators is a fundamental pillar of and is\nessential to a proper functioning democracy. Self-regulation or self-'govermance'\nrefers to the profession's ability to set and enforce its own regulation, free\nfrom influence as far as possible. This entails the profession's right to set\nits own rules and set up bodies to oversee compliance with those rules. ","index":"00368","speaker":""},{"html":"Before the current act went to committee, by letter dated September\n19th, 2007, the society's then-CEO Mr. Allan Fineblit wrote to minister Nancy\nAllan setting out concerns about the proposed legislation. And he said, in\nCanada we are so accustomed to living in a free society that we generally do\nnot pause from day-to-day to remember that some of the critical principles underpinning\nthat freedom such as the prohibition against arbitrary arrest, the right to be\nbrought before a judge within 24 hours of being arrested, the right to be tried\nin public and the right to consult a lawyer who is not employed by the\ngovernment of the day, are subject to the commands of the government of the day\nall depend upon the existence of an independent legal profession.

Section 5 requires a regulated profession to\nnotify the director of proposed changes to its registration practices.

","index":"00374","speaker":""},{"html":"Advising the director of proposed changes may actually result in the\nminister exercising broad discretion to issue a compliance order under new\nsection 15.4(1). We note with concern that it is an offence under the act to be\nin non-compliance. We are even more concerned about section 15.4(4) that\nprescribes what must be in a compliance order. It states that the order must\nset out any action the regulated profession must take to remedy the failure\nincluding, but not limited to making, amending or repealing any regulation,\nrule, bylaw, criteria used to assess whether requirements for registration have\nbeen met, or other measures specified in the order.","index":"00375","speaker":""},{"html":"�In other words, the minister may come to an opinion about the actions\nof the regulator, issue a compliance order, and make the regulator change the\ncriteria it uses to assess whether registration require�ments have been met.\nOther sections in the bill amount to further erosion of the authorities\nstatutorily given to the Law Society to self-regulate in the public interest. ","index":"00376","speaker":""},{"html":"Section 8.1(1) of the bill states that a regulated profession must take\nreasonable steps to collaborate with education providers and employers to\nidentify opportunities to develop programs that may assist not only\ninternationally educated individuals, but also unsuccessful applicants in\nobtaining registration in their regulated profession; and then requires the\nregulator to develop programs that have been identified. This section is\nparticularly concerning because it amounts to an intrusion upon our ability to\ndetermine the most appropriate and feasible manner in which we have to fulfill\nand should be fulfilling our public interest mandate. ","index":"00377","speaker":""},{"html":"We recognize that some on the committee may point to section 14(3) and\nsay there is some protection set out in the bill because there is a limit on\nthe involvement of the director. It says that the director must not become\ninvolved in a registration decision or an internal review or an appeal on\nbehalf of an applicant or potential applicant. However, the pro�posed\namendments authorize the government, we submit, to become involved in the\nregulatory practices themselves, and therefore potentially affect many\ndecisions.","index":"00378","speaker":""},{"html":"����� In\npreparing for our submission, we reviewed the comparable legislation in Nova\nScotia and note that it takes a far more balanced approach.

","index":"00399","speaker":""},{"html":"<b>Ms.\nSenft:</b> I was referring to a lot of our access initiatives such as even the\nbill that was�we spoke to a couple of weeks ago, The Legal Profession Amendment\nAct, where the Law Society itself asked the government to amend our act so that\nwe could provide further exemptions to the unauthorized practise of law\nprovisions, recognizing that there are all sorts of individuals out there who\nare providing important legal services, although they are not lawyers because\nthey are meeting unmet legal needs. ","index":"00400","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And we\nalso sought specifically in the government, and we are so grateful that the\ngovernment responded to our requests, and have put in not only that amendment\nbut also an amendment that would allow the Law Society to create a whole new\ncategory of legal service provider called a limited practitioner, who would\nconceivably, we expect, to have far less of a need for as much education that a\nlawyer currently requires. You need, you know, your undergrad degree or at\nleast two years, three years of law school, one year of articling, writing of\nthe bar exams. Clearly, if we put a limited scope on that ability to practice,\nto provide some legal services, there wouldn't be the need to go through all of\nthat. ","index":"00401","speaker":""},{"html":"����� That's\none way that we are hoping to remove some barriers. We are still in our\nconsultation period. We've received over 50 responses from the profession.\nWe're awaiting some comments from the judiciary and then we have to go further\nto the public because that's who we have to serve in the public interest. ","index":"00402","speaker":""},{"html":"And sometimes we're on the difficult position where members of the\nprofession might think, well, what are you doing? You're going too far.

In fact, as I said,\nall of the law societies did. You know, and we commend all of them for working\nhard at that effort.

","index":"00414","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Manitoba\nBuilding Trades�as a private sector entity, we work as a human resource and\nproject partner with many of the large, unionized general contractors in\nManitoba.

It should not be considered a full\nconsultation without consideration given to this reality in our sector and, up\nto date, that hasn't been so. The apprenticeship board, the department and the\ngovernment will miss critical information from segments of the industry if, for\nexample, a residential-construction representative were advising on regulations\nthat will impact industrial electricians working at an industrial plant. You\nknow, wiring a home and wiring a hydro dam are two entirely different\nundertakings with entirely different risks.","index":"00422","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Thirdly,\nBill 61 enables the board to establish standards of training and practical\nexperience for programs. Therefore, it is critical that a process for voices of\njourneypersons and on-the-ground supervisors be represented within the\napprenticeship system. This is something that is lacking at the current board\nas it stands, and there�sorry, and based on the text of Bill 61, it is either\nunclear or lacking consideration to the board-appointment process to make sure\nthat the people with the job-set experience are having the voice at the table\nproportionate to the amount of apprentices they represent.","index":"00423","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Again,\nwhile it's important that changes are made to the current system, it's just as\nimportant to make sure these changes have the desired effect on actually\nimproving the system, approving accountability and improving apprenticeship\noverall.","index":"00424","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Right\nnow in Canada�and the same applies to Manitoba�the average age of apprentices\nentering into the system is 30 years old. That's 10 years of critical learning\nafter high school where, you know, multiple barriers in either lifestyle or\naccess to education or financial situations can become a barrier to getting\nback into an apprenticeship system at that age.","index":"00425","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Also,\nnationally, our apprenticeship completion rate is only 50 per cent.

But we just saw probably the most\nsubstantial change we have seen and will see in decades, which is changing the\nratios overnight, and as I mentioned in my statement, we weren't aware. Most of\nour employers weren't aware. Most of our employer associations, both union and\nnon-union, were not aware of the change coming through. ","index":"00439","speaker":""},{"html":"Meanwhile, 61 shows that there is an admittance that the consultation\nwith industry has been lacking, and yet the most critical change that we've had\nin the apprenticeship system in a decade has come through before we're given\nthe chance for Bill 61 to hopefully reform some of the issues that I've pointed\nout. ","index":"00440","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So I\nknow our group is consistent on pushing the message to hold that regulation\nchange, although it has gone through, to allow for some of the positive aspects\nof Bill 61 to come forward. The two-to-one ratios will result in many, many\njourneymen being laid off, as they'll be replaced by 'accreniceship'�apprentices.\nWe don't have the current project volume or demand right now in our market;\nsomething from a one-to-one to a two-to-one ratio works really well when you\nhave so, so much work and you don't have enough people to fill the jobs\nlocally.

","index":"00717","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\ngenerally, we are not opposed to changes and modernization of the\napprenticeship system. Having said that, you know, it is important to recognize\nthat over the past few months apprenticeship�and, Minister Eichler, you know,\nwe've been before you talking about a number of these issues, that this system\nhas undergone significant and frequent changes.

This,\nyou know, other speakers have commented that perhaps the effort seems a bit\nrushed and I wouldn't necessarily say that given that the whole process started\nback, you know, sometime around 2016 that it's rushed, but the end product\nseems to have gaps and significant holes that we need to fill as yet and\nperhaps that is the purpose of the legislative committee process; to understand\nthose and to make sure we enact what works and take the opportunity now to\naddress any shortcomings.","index":"00723","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nthe apprenticeship board, in our view, must be reflective of the industries it\nservices and serves and must be constituted to have sufficient representation\nof primary stakeholders. You know, boards are work and this board ought to be\nwork. It is not an appointment for the sake of an appointment. As Mr. Hambley\npointed out, we are going from 15 to 12. That means that expertise and ability\nto demonstrate the qualifications necessary to contribute meaning�fully to a\nboard such as this become even more critical. And, you know, whether it's a\nmatrix as Ms.&nbsp;Coey recommended in her written submission, which is very\nthoughtful, you know, whatever system we enact to select board members who are\ngoing to be contributing agents for this board is really going to become very\nimportant.","index":"00724","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Consultation,\nyou know, we've heard so much tonight about consultation, the lack thereof, the\nwrong, you know, focus on the wrong types of input, et cetera, or not timely\ninput. The general theme is that consultation is�has always been important,\ngiven that the apprenticeship board, through its stakeholders, attempts to\nserve an industry unlike any other system in that�that's so direct and engaged\nwith industry, that consultation becomes really a key driver. And to that\nextent, we look at the sector-based committees which are replacing the PAC\nsystem. I think anyone's who's been around apprenticeship will acknowledge that\nPACs had their own issues. And now that we're replacing that with a SBC\nsector-based committee process, we have to be careful that there are no�that\nthe committees are not so broad that, again, the consultation process suffers\nbecause voices get buried in that committee.","index":"00725","speaker":""},{"html":"����� And\nsecondly, the committee should have some influence. One of the failures of PACs\nwas that they did have an input process but it was what I like call it\nsometimes, a parking lot stop sign. You were�there were more suggestions than\nthey were meaningfully taken contributions that really resulted in the policy\nand, subsequently, legislative or regulatory changes that came through\ngovernment or the apprenticeship system.","index":"00726","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nthe sector-based committees must be con�stituted thoughtfully, with purpose.\nThey must reflect the industry they represent and be given a very meaningful\nvoice so that we don't lose the fullness of the stakeholder engagement. That is\nalways going to be a contingent factor on which the success of the\napprenticeship system is based. And if we do not have an effective board and\ncommittee structure and constitution, both in the expertise that they bring and\nthe diversity of experiences that they carry, Minister Eichler, I would suggest\nto you that under section 8(2), you may be called upon to overrule far more\noften than you would ever want to as a minister.","index":"00727","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\nyou will have heard from many other industry representatives tonight. Both my\ncolleagues, you know, Ramona Coey from MCAM, Mr. Hambley, Mr. Wightman is yet\nto come later on in the evening, and we concur. I think what's remarkable is\nthat there is significant concurrence within the industry on broad strokes as\nto what the system needed in terms of refreshment, where it is lacking, what we\nneed to do more of and less of in some cases. And you should be heartened, as a\ncommittee, and Minister Eichler, that you do have so much consensus in terms of\nwhat industry as a whole is putting before you.","index":"00728","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Again,\nas I said, I'm not going to touch on other things that have transpired over the\nlast few months.

One of them was about\nmandating the need to consult as opposed to leaving it as may consult.

Sandhu:\n</b>Through the Chair: Mr.&nbsp;Lindsey, yes. I think that mandating more\nconsultation is important. I'll give you an example in a minute as to where the\nrubber hits the road on that. ","index":"00745","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So,\njust�as I said, a parking lot stop sign type of consultation process is not\nhelpful, because it's far too easily overlooked. So, the government has an\nopportunity to mandate certain <i>[inaudible]</i> in the manner, the types and\nthe quality of stakeholders that are engaged in the process and what weight is\ngiven to the consultation that occurs and the input that flows up from the\nground level up. That's really important.","index":"00746","speaker":""},{"html":"����� Secondly,\ngoing to the national standards. Look, I'm not just pumping our collective\ntires by saying that Manitoba has a very well-respected skilled trade workforce\nacross the country. It is not uncommon, and I've made this point previously,\nyou know, on Bill 55, that our skilled workforce, when on occasion they do go\nout of Manitoba to work in other jurisdictions, often end up as supervisors and\nlead hands, etc., because they are well respected. And that means that there's\nsome things we are doing here that are very good, and we need to retain those. ","index":"00747","speaker":""},{"html":"����� So\nwhen it comes to harmonization�and by the way, we are very�trade mobility�or\ntrades flexibility and mobility is really, really important to us because we\noften face the indignation in this country where workers in Ontario or\nNewfoundland or Manitoba may be on layoff, collecting EI while, you know, BC is\nimporting workers from elsewhere. That is really an untenable situation. So to\nthe extent that harmoni�zation can limit that and create�contribute to mobility\nof our workforce across the country, that's a good thing.","index":"00748","speaker":""},{"html":"����� But\nlet's drive the bus on that.

That's really important, because we are working with employers, as both\nlabour and employer, working together to address industry needs. You know, over\nthe�in about 2016, I have never seen that much consensus in an industry, where\n98 per cent of the industry made a submission to this government that the\nplumbing trade ought to be made a designated compulsory trade, and with one\nstroke of a pen, industry was told to go away and not even come back for three\nyears.
