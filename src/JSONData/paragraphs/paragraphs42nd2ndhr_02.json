I felt a little bad that the MLA who\ninitiated this bill was left on his own and he wasn't able to answer some of\nthe simple questions that were directed at him; I think there were six of them.\nAnd another MLA stood up on his behalf, and he said that he was a former\nfinancial planner for investors and his feelings and advice to his clients was\nthe CV was a bad idea. And then I guess he realized that this was being\nbroadcast and it would be available forever and he changed his response and he\nsaid he was actual an accountant.

My wife's pension will pay her approximately 70 to\n75 thousand dollars a year. The survivor benefit is 55 per cent, approximately,\nsame as mine with CN: 55 per cent survivor. If and when we both are no longer\nhere our estate receives zip. By going through the cumulative value, her\n'cumutive' value is actually $1.2 million, and approximately half of that,\n$600,000 we'll say, will be locked in with�into what they call a LIRA. And\nbased on the numbers she is expected to draw on that LIRA. So being 56 years of\nage to 84, approximately 28 years, receiving roughly $39,000 a year. When she's\n84 she will have $600,000 still in that LIRA plus another $100,000. So our\nestate for our kids will receive $700,000.

I think it's important to note that my committee represents the\nmembers of the pension plan, and we have given fulsome consideration to this\nmatter over a course of time from a fiduciary standpoint.

","index":"00153","speaker":""},{"html":"����� I think the most important thing to be cognizant of regarding Bill\n43 and the CV issue is that it does not change pension benefits. Of course,\nmembers will still be able to continue and retire, and it will�they can depend\non their well-earned monthly pension cheque, which is exactly what the vast\nmajority of members of this pension plan do and exactly what the plan is\ndesigned to provide.

The CSSB plan truly is an outlier in this regard.

As the\nCSSA actuary, we provide the following brief background concerning the\nevolution of lumpsum payments under the CSSA and the rationale for the adoption\nof a going concern lumpsum commuted value basis:","index":"00213","speaker":""},{"html":"1.�� The CSSA is a\nmulti‐employer retirement program that was formed in 1939 as an\namalgamation of several retirement programs with the intent of providing a\nsuperannuation or pension to its members and their survivors on retirement.","index":"00214","speaker":""},{"html":"2.�� Prior to 1985,\nthe CSSA, as well as all other pension plans, generally did not provide for\nlumpsum payments other than a refund of member contributions with interest in\ncertain limited situations.","index":"00215","speaker":""},{"html":"3.�� In 1985,\nlumpsum \"commuted value\" (CV) payouts were introduced by The Manitoba\nPension Benefits Act (PBA) to allow members additional options and portability\nof their pension if they so choose. The method of CV calculation was stipulated\nto follow the Standards of Practice provided by the Canadian Institute of\nActuaries (CIA) in that same year, or as amended from time to time.","index":"00216","speaker":""},{"html":"4.�� CV mandatory\nportability of the lumpsum was made a requirement of the PBA if a terminating\nmember was less than the earliest retirement age, generally 55. If the\nterminating member was eligible to retire, that is generally over age 55, it\nremained the discretion of the plan sponsor to optionally provide a portable\nlumpsum in lieu of a pension stream for life. Other than the CSSA, we are not\naware of any pension plans that provide the lumpsum portability option once the\nmember can retire and otherwise receive a pension for life. For example, The MB\nTeachers Pension Plan, the MB HealthCare Employees' Pension Plan, and the City\nof Winnipeg Civic Employees' Pension Plan do not provide lumpsum portability in\nthe retirement window.","index":"00217","speaker":""},{"html":"5.�� The CV method\nstipulated historically by the CIA has used the bond‐like interest rates\nat the time of payment. The bond‐like interest rates are generally\ndifferent from the going concern interest rate used to establish the liabilities\nand funding contributions made to the CSSA. The going concern interest rate is\nbased on the expected rate of return of the portfolio of assets in the pension\nfund and is currently assumed to be 5.75%. The bond‐like interest rate\nused to calculate the CVs is currently less than 2.50%. This difference creates\na loss to the pension plan as the lower interest rates produce a CV higher than\nthe going concern liability. In the period 1985 to 2005 the determination of\nthe CV based on a bond market environment, in balance, did not adversely affect\nthe financial health of pension programs in Canada, including the CSSA.\nHowever, since 2005, as a result of the unanticipated persistent low bond\ninterest environment, the lumpsum payments generally exceeded the going concern\nassets set aside by the members and plan sponsors to fund the pension promise.\nAs a result, significant losses in the pension plan occurred that must\nultimately be funded by additional employee and employer contributions and/or a\nreduction in the pension promise. The attached table estimates these losses to\nexceed $625&nbsp;million in the last 15&nbsp;years and the expectation in 2020\nand going forward is that this number will grow at an accelerated rate unless\naction is taken.","index":"00218","speaker":""},{"html":"6.�� The current\nsituation is a zero‐sum game, that is, for every gain to someone taking a\nCV from the CSSA there is a loss to everyone else who remains in the CSSA. In\nthis case the member departing with the bond‐like CV is gaining at the\nexpense of the retirees and remaining active contributors within the CSSA who\nwill likely have jeopardized cost‐of‐living adjustments in the\nfuture and inevitable increases in contributions.","index":"00219","speaker":""},{"html":"7.�� To remedy the\nsituation, some provinces (British Columbia and Alberta) have legislated in the\nlast few years the payment of going concern CVs be authorized in certain\nmulti‐employer pension plans.","index":"00220","speaker":""},{"html":"8.�� The CIA has\nresponded by revising its Standards of Practice to calculate CVs not only on a\nbond‐ like manner but also on a going concern‐like manner for\neligible plans.","index":"00221","speaker":""},{"html":"9.�� Further,\nconsidering the COVID‐19 pandemic, some legislative jurisdictions are\nallowing pension plans to temporarily suspend the payment of CVs in today's low\nbond interest rate environment.","index":"00222","speaker":""},{"html":"10.� In order, to\nbring the CSSA in line with best practices in the pension industry, the actuary\nfor the CSSA supports the adoption of the new CIA Standards of Practice section\n3570 for the calculation of CVs under the CSSA.","index":"00223","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">11.� Meetings\nhave occurred with The Civil Service Superannuation Board, Employee Liaison\nCommittee, and the Employer Advisory Committee established under the CSSA and\nit is our understanding that they all support the change to the adoption of the\nnew CIA Standards of Practice section 3570.</span>","index":"00224","speaker":""},{"html":"<span lang=\"EN-US\">12.� The\nadoption of the new CIA Standards of Practice would place the CSSA on more\nequal footing with other pension programs in Canada, reduce in part, the\nuncertainty of additional contribution requirements from employees and\nemployers participating in the CSSA, and significantly enhance the sustainability\nof the CSSA in delivering the basic pension promise to its members. The CV\nchange, if it receives Royal Assent, will ensure that the CV election of the\nmember will not generate a loss or a gain under the CSSA.</span>","index":"00225","speaker":""},{"html":"<b><span style=\"font-size:8.0pt\">Estimated\nCommuted Value Losses - 15 Year Period 2005 - 2019</span></b>","index":"00226","speaker":""},{"html":"Note� The above\n$445,287,000, before interest, estimates 42.3% of the $1,051,779,000 refunds is\nan actuarial loss.

I\nhave appreciated promoting equitable access to healthcare with my rural career.\nIn 1997, the health regions were regionalized into health authorities and\nmassive changes arose from regionalization, but I remained a Provincial Civil\nServant with the Civil Service Superannuation Pension plan. In 2015, after\nlong-time service as a healthcare provider, I made the decision to move to\nanother area of the province and my employer became a new regional health\nauthority.

I am proposing that the\nCSSB is allowed to send out communication related to this Bill and its'\nchanges, then a two month period is offered that allows\nindividuals/professionals such as myself to make a decision and allow for a\nsmooth transition of the civil service departure and replacement�before\nenactment of the bill actually takes place.
