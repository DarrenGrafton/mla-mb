          <p>
            Manitoban MLAs (mlamb.ca) uses the open north API to find a
            provincial electoral district based on your location. If you share
            your location with the website when you load the Map feature, it
            will send your current location to the open north website, which
            will return the name of the electoral division that contains that
            location.

          <h3>Contributing and Ideas</h3>
          <p>
            The intention for the site is to make it simple for any Manitoban to
            get information about their particular MLA.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have suggestions to make finding information through this
            site easier, please let us know.
          </p>
          <p>
            We would love to include more information on the site but it must
            meet the following criteria:
          </p>
          <ul
            style={{
              listStyle: "circle",
              padding: "0 10px",
              margin: "0 0 10px 10px",
            }}
          >
            <li>
              Relevant to the Member's work in the Legislature or information
              about the constituency
            </li>
            <li>
              Reliable Source - Information publicly available or obtained
              through a transparent process
            </li>
            <li>
              Appropriate to be on the same site as links to the Hansard
              transcripts, no "undignified associations"
            </li>
